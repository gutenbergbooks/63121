<h2 class="nobreak">PREFACE.</h2></div>


<p>The author is aware that she is entering a field which
has been diligently cultivated by the best minds in Europe
and America. Her design in the preparation of this story is
to give to the public a sketch of her ideas on the effect of
&#8220;true love.&#8221; I have tried to make the plot exciting without
being sensational or common, although within the
bounds of proper romance, and create a set of characters
most of whom are like real people with whose thoughts
and passions we are able to sympathize and whose language
and conduct may be appreciable or reprehensible
according to circumstances. Great pains have been taken
to make this work superior in its arrangement and finish
and in the general tastefulness of its mechanical execution.
How nearly the author has accomplished her purpose to
give to the public in one volume a clear and complete
treatise on this subject, combining many fine qualities of
importance to the reader, the intelligent and experienced
public must decide.</p>

<p class="drop-cap">A FINE old door of oak, a heavy door standing deep
within a portico inside of which you might have
driven a coach, brings you to the residence of
Mrs. Brewster. The hall was dark and small, the only
light admitted to it being from windows of stained glass;
numberless passages branched off from the hall, one peculiarity
being that you could scarcely enter a single room
in it but you must first go down a passage, short or
long, to get to it; had the house been designed by an
architect with a head upon his shoulders and a little common
sense within it, he might have made a respectable
house to say the least; as it was, the rooms were
cramped and narrow, cornered and confined, and the
good space was taken up by these worthless passages; a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_2"></a>[2]</span>
plat of ground before it was crowded with flowers, far
too crowded for good taste, as the old gardener would
point out to her, but Mrs. Brewster loved flowers and
would not part with one of them. Being the daughter
of a carpenter and the wife of a merchant tailor, she had
scrambled through life amidst bustle and poverty, moving
from one house to another, never settled anywhere
for long. It was an existence not to be envied, although
it is the lot of many. She was Mrs. Brewster and her
husband was not a very good husband to her; he was
rather too fond of amusing himself, and threw all the
care upon her shoulders; she spent her time nursing her
sickly children and endeavouring to make one dollar go
as far as two. One day, to her unspeakable embarrassment,
she found herself changed from a poor woman in
moderate circumstances to an heiress to a certain degree,
her father having received a legacy from a relative,
and upon his death it was willed to her. She had
much sorrow, having lost one child after another, until
she had but two left. Then she lost her husband and
father; then settled at Bellville near her husband&#8217;s native
place, upon her limited means. All she possessed
was the interest upon this sum her father had left her,
the whole not exceeding $2,000. She had two daughters,
Mary Ann and Janey; the contrast between them
was great, you could see it most remarkably as they sat
together, and her love for them was as contrasted as
light is with darkness. Mary Ann she regarded with<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_3"></a>[3]</span>
an inordinate affection amounting almost to a passion;
for Janey she did not care; what could be the reason of
this; what is the reason that parents, many such may be
found, will love some of their children and dislike others
they cannot tell any more than she could; ask them and
they will be unable to give you an answer. It does not
lie in the children; it often happens that those obtaining
the least love will be the most deserving of it. Such
was the case here. Mary Ann Brewster was a pale,
sickly, fretful girl, full of whims, full of complaints, giving
trouble to everybody about her. Janey, with her
sweet countenance and her merry heart, made the sunshine
of her home; she bore with her sister&#8217;s exacting
moods, she bore with her mother&#8217;s want of love, she
loved them both and waited on them, and carrolled forth
her snatches of song as she moved around the house,
and was as happy as the day was long. Ask the servants&mdash;they
kept only two&mdash;and they would tell you that
Mrs. Brewster was cross and selfish, but Miss Janey
was worth her weight in gold; the gold was soon to be
transplanted to a home where it would be appreciated
and cherished, for Janey was the affianced wife of
Charles Taylor. For nearly a mile beyond Bellville
lived Charles Taylor, a quiet, refined gentleman, and
the son of a wealthy capitalist; his father had not only
made a fortune of his own, but had several bestowed
upon him; he had died several years before this time,
and his wife survived him one year. There were three<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_4"></a>[4]</span>
sisters, a cousin and two servants that had lived in this
family for a number of years.</p>

<p>The beams of the setting sun streamed into the dining-room
of the Taylor mansion; it was a room of
fine proportions, not dull and heavy as it is the custom
of some dining-rooms, but light and graceful
as could be wished. Charles Taylor, with his
fine beauty, sat at one end of the room, Miss
Mary Taylor, a maiden lady of mature years, good
looking also in her peculiar style, sat opposite him, she
wore a white dress, its make remarkably young, and
her hair fell in ringlets, young also; at her right-hand
sat Matilda, singularly attractive in her quiet loveliness,
with her silver dotted muslin dress trimmed with white
ribbons; at her left sat Martha, quiet in manner, plain
in features; she had large gray eyes, reflective strangely
deep, with a circle of darker gray around them, when
they were cast upon you it was not at you they looked,
but at what was within you, at your mind, your thoughts;
at least such was the impression they carried. Thus sat
this worthy group, deep in thought, for they had been
conversing about the weather, that had been so damp,
for it had been raining for months, and the result was a
malarial fever, visiting the residents of Bellville, and it
was very dangerous, for the sufferer would soon lapse
into unconsciousness and all was over; and it was generally
believed that the fever was abated. A rap at the
door brought Charles Taylor to his feet, it was George,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_5"></a>[5]</span>
the old gardener, he had come to tell them the fever had
broken out again. &#8220;What!&#8221; exclaimed Charles. &#8220;The
fever broken out again?&#8221; &#8220;Yes, it have,&#8221; said George,
who had the build of a Dutchman, and was taciturn
upon most subjects; in manner he was most surly and
would hold his own opinion, especially if it touched upon
his occupation, against the world.</p>

<p>The news fell upon Charles&#8217; heart like a knell; he fully
believed the danger to have passed, though not yet the
sickness. &#8220;Are you sure that the fever has broken out
again, George?&#8221; he asked, after a pause. &#8220;I ain&#8217;t no
surer than I was told,&#8221; returned George. &#8220;I met Doctor
Brown, and he said as he passed, that the fever had
broken out again.&#8221; &#8220;Do you know where?&#8221; asked
Charles. &#8220;He said, I believe, but I didn&#8217;t catch it; if I
stopped to listen to the talk of fevers where would my
work be?&#8221; George moved on ere he had done speaking,
possibly from the impression that the present talk
was not forwarding his work. Taking his black silk hat
Charles said, &#8220;I shall go out and see if I can glean any
news; I hope it may be a false report.&#8221; He was just
outside the walks when he saw Doctor Brown, the most
popular doctor in the village, coming along quickly in
his buggy; Charles motioned his hand, and the driver
pulled up. &#8220;Is it true, this fresh report of fever?&#8221; &#8220;Too
true, I fear,&#8221; replied the doctor. &#8220;I am on my way
now, just summoned.&#8221; &#8220;Who&#8217;s attacked?&#8221; &#8220;Mary
Ann Brewster.&#8221; The name appeared to startle Charles.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_6"></a>[6]</span>
&#8220;Mary Ann Brewster,&#8221; he uttered, &#8220;she will never pull
through it.&#8221; The doctor raised his eye-brows as if he
thought it doubtful, and motioned to his driver to move
on. On the morning in question Mary Ann Brewster
awoke sick; in her impatient, fretful way she
called out to Janey, who slept in an adjoining room.
Janey was fast asleep, but she was used to being
aroused out of her sleep at unreasonable hours by
Mary Ann and she threw on her dressing-gown and
hastened to her. &#8220;I want some tea,&#8221; began Mary Ann,
&#8220;I am as sick and thirsty as I can be.&#8221; She was really
of a sickly constitution and to hear her complain of being
&#8220;sick and thirsty&#8221; was nothing unusual. Janey in her
loving nature, her sweet patience, received the information
with as much concern as though she had never
heard it before. She bent over Mary Ann and spoke
tenderly, &#8220;where do you feel pain, dear, in your head
or chest, where is it?&#8221; &#8220;I told you that I was sick
and thirsty, and that&#8217;s enough,&#8221; peevishly answered
Mary Ann. &#8220;Go and get me some tea.&#8221; &#8220;As soon as
I can,&#8221; said Janey, soothingly. &#8220;There is no fire yet, the
girls are not up, I do not think it can be later than four,
by the look of the morning.&#8221; &#8220;Very well,&#8221; cried Mary
Ann, the sobs being contrived by the catching up of her
breath in temper not by tears, &#8220;you can&#8217;t call the maids
I suppose, and you can&#8217;t put yourself the least out of
the way to alleviate my suffering; you want to go to
bed again and sleep till nine o&#8217;clock; when I am dead<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_7"></a>[7]</span>
you will wish you were more like a sister; you possess
great, rude health yourself, and you feel no compassion
for those who do not.&#8221; An assertion unjust and untrue
like many others made by Mary Ann. Janey did
not possess rude health, though she was not like her sister
always complaining, and she had more compassion
for Mary Ann than she deserved. &#8220;I will see what I
can do,&#8221; she gently said, &#8220;you shall soon have some
tea.&#8221; Passing into her own room Janey hastily dressed
herself. When Mary Ann was in one of her exacting
moods there could be no more sleep for Janey.</p>

<p>&#8220;I wonder,&#8221; she said to herself, &#8220;whether I could not
make the fire without waking the girls, they had such a
hard day&#8217;s work yesterday cleaning house; yes, if I can
get some chips I will make a fire.&#8221; She went down to
the kitchen, hunted up what was required, laid the fire
and lighted it; it did not burn quickly, she thought the
chips might be damp and she got the bellows; there she
was on her knees blowing at the chips and sending the
blaze amid the coals, when some one entered the
kitchen. &#8220;Miss Janey!&#8221; It was one of the girls, Eliza;
she had heard a noise in the kitchen and had arisen.
Janey explained that her sister was sick and tea was
wanted. &#8220;Why did you not call us?&#8221; &#8220;You went to
bed so late and had worked so hard, I thought that I
would not disturb you.&#8221; &#8220;But it is not lady&#8217;s work,
Miss.&#8221; &#8220;I think ladies should put on gloves when they
undertake it,&#8221; gayly laughed Janey; &#8220;look at my black<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_8"></a>[8]</span>
hands.&#8221; &#8220;What would Mr. Taylor say if he saw you
on your knees lighting a fire?&#8221; &#8220;He would say I was
doing right, Eliza,&#8221; replied Janey, a shade of reproof in
her firm tones, though the allusion caused the color to
crimson her cheeks; the girl had been with them some
time and assumed more privilege than a less respected
servant would have been allowed to do. The tea ready
Janey carried a cup of it to her sister, with a slice of
toast that she had made. Mary Ann drank the tea at a
draught, but she turned with a shiver from the toast, she
seemed to be shivering much. &#8220;Who was so stupid as
to make that? you might know I could not eat it, I am
too sick.&#8221; Janey began to think she looked very sick,
her face was flushed shivering though she was, her lips
were dry, her bright eyes were unnaturally heavy; she
gently laid her hands, cleanly washed, upon her sister&#8217;s
brow; it felt burning, and Mary Ann screamed out, &#8220;Do
keep your hands away, my head is splitting with pain.&#8221;
All at once Janey thought of the fever, the danger from
which they had been reckoning to have passed. &#8220;Would
you like me to bathe your forehead with water, Mary
Ann?&#8221; asked Janey, kindly. &#8220;I would like you to stop
until things are asked for and not to worry me,&#8221; replied
Mary Ann. Janey sighed, not for the cross temper,
Mary Ann was always cross in sickness, but for the suffering
she thought she saw and the half-doubt, half-dread
which had arisen within her. I think I had better
call mamma, she thought to herself, though if she sees<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_9"></a>[9]</span>
nothing unusual the matter with Mary Ann she will only
be angry with me; proceeding to her mother&#8217;s chamber
Janey knocked gently, her mother slept still, but the entrance
aroused her. &#8220;Mamma, I do not like to disturb
you, but Mary Ann is sick.&#8221; &#8220;Sick again, and only
last week she was in bed three days, poor, dear sufferer;
is it her chest?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Mamma she seems unusually ill, otherwise I should
not have disturbed you, I feared, I thought you will be
angry with me, if I say, perhaps&#8221;; &#8220;say what, don&#8217;t
stand like a statue, Janey.&#8221; Janey dropped her voice,
&#8220;dear mamma, suppose it should be the fever?&#8221; For
one startling moment Mrs. Brewster felt as if a dagger
was piercing her heart; the next she turned upon Janey.
&#8220;Fever for Mary Ann! How dared she prophesy it,
a low common fever confined to the poor and the town
and which had gone away or all but; was it likely to
turn itself back again and come up here to attack her
darling child?&#8221; Janey, the tears in her eyes, said she hoped
it would prove to be only a common headache; that it
was her love for Mary Ann which awoke her fears.
The mother proceeded to the sick-chamber and Janey
followed. Mrs. Brewster was not accustomed to observe
caution and she spoke freely of the &#8220;fever&#8221; before
Mary Ann; seemingly for the purpose of casting blame
upon Janey. Mary Ann did not catch the fear, she ridiculed
Janey as her mother had done; for several hours
Mrs. Brewster did not catch it either, she would have<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_10"></a>[10]</span>
summoned medical aid at first, but Mary Ann in her
fretfulness protested that she would not have a doctor;
later she grew worse and Doctor Brown was sent for,
you saw him in his buggy going to the house.</p>

<p>Mrs. Brewster came forward to meet him, Janey, full
of anxiety, near her. Mrs. Brewster was a thin woman,
with a shriveled face and a sharp red nose, her gray
hair banded closely under a white cap, her style of head-dress
never varied, it consisted always of a plain cap
with a quilled border trimmed with purple ribbon, her
black dresses she had not laid aside since the death of
her husband and intended never to do so. She grasped
the arm of the doctor, &#8220;You must save my child!&#8221;
&#8220;Higher aid permitting me,&#8221; answered the surgeon.
&#8220;What makes you think it&#8217;s the fever? For months I
have been summoned by timid parents to any number of
fever cases and when I have arrived in haste they have
turned out to be no fever at all.&#8221; &#8220;This is the fever,&#8221;
Mrs. Brewster replied; &#8220;had I been more willing to admit
that it was, you would have been sent for hours ago,
it was Janey&#8217;s fault; she suggested at daybreak that it
might be the fever, and it made my darling girl so angry
that she forbade my sending for advice; but she is worse
now, come and see her.&#8221; The doctor laid his hand upon
Janey&#8217;s head with a fond gesture as he followed Mrs.
Brewster; all the neighbors of Bellville loved Janey Brewster.
Tossing upon her uneasy bed, her face crimson,
her hair floating untidily around it, lay Mary Ann, still<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_11"></a>[11]</span>
shivering; the doctor gave one glance at her, it was quite
enough to satisfy him that the mother was not mistaken.</p>

<p>&#8220;Is it the fever,&#8221; impatiently asked Mary Ann, unclosing
her hot eyelids; &#8220;if it is we must drive it away,&#8221;
said the doctor cheerfully. &#8220;Why should the fever
have come to me?&#8221; she rejoined in a tone of rebellion.
&#8220;Why was I thrown from my buggy last year and my
back sprained? Such unpleasant things do come to us.&#8221;
&#8220;To sprain your back is nothing compared with this
fever; you got well again.&#8221; &#8220;And we will get you well
if you will be quiet and reasonable.&#8221; &#8220;I am so hot, my
head is so heavy.&#8221; The doctor, who had called for
water and a glass, was mixing up a brown powder which
he had produced from his pocket; she drank it without
opposition, and then he lessened the weight of the bed-clothes,
and afterwards turned his attention to the bed-room.
It was close and hot, and the sun which had just
burst forth brightly from the gray sky shone full upon it.
&#8220;You have got the chimney stuffed up,&#8221; he exclaimed.
&#8220;Mary Ann will not allow it to be open,&#8221; said Mrs.
Brewster; &#8220;she is sensitive to cold, and feels the slightest
draught.&#8221; The doctor walked to the chimney,
turned up his coat cuff and wristband and pulled down
a bag filled with shavings; some soot came with it and
covered his hand, but he did not mind that; he was as
little given to ceremony as Mrs. Brewster was to caution,
and he walked leisurely up to the wash-stand to wash it<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_12"></a>[12]</span>
off. &#8220;Now, if I catch that bag or any other bag up
there obstructing the air, I shall pull down the bricks
and make a good big hole that the sky can be seen
through; of that I give you notice, madam.&#8221; He next
pulled the window down at the top behind the blind, but
the room at its best did not find favor with him. &#8220;It is
not airy; it is not cool,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Is there not a better
ventilated room in the house? if so, she shall be moved
to it.&#8221; &#8220;My room is a cool one,&#8221; interposed Janey
eagerly; &#8220;the sun never shines upon it, doctor.&#8221; It appears
that Janey, thus speaking, must have reminded
the doctor that she was present for in the same unceremonious
fashion that he had laid his hands upon the
chimney bag, he now laid them upon her shoulder and
walked her out of the room. &#8220;You go down stairs,
Miss Janey, and do not come within a mile of this room
again until I give you notice.&#8221; During this time Mary
Ann was talking imperiously and fretfully. &#8220;I will not
be moved into Janey&#8217;s room; it is not furnished with
half the comforts of mine; it has only a little bed-side
carpet; I will not go there, doctor.&#8221; &#8220;Now, see here,
Mary Ann,&#8221; said the doctor firmly, &#8220;I am responsible
for getting you well, and I shall take my own way to do
it. If I am to be contradicted at every suggestion, your
mother can summon some one else to attend you, I will
not undertake it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My dear you shall not be moved to Janey&#8217;s room;&#8221;
said her mother coaxingly; &#8220;you shall be moved to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_13"></a>[13]</span>
mine, it is larger than this, you know, doctor, with a
draught through it, if you wish to open the door and
windows.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Very well,&#8221; replied the doctor, &#8220;let me find her in it
when I come again this evening, and if there&#8217;s a carpet
on the floor take it up, carpets were never intended for
bed-rooms.&#8221; He went into one of the sitting-rooms with
Mrs. Brewster as he descended; &#8220;What do you think
of the case,&#8221; she earnestly inquired. &#8220;There will be
some difficulty with it,&#8221; was his candid reply. &#8220;Her hair
must be cut off.&#8221; &#8220;Her hair cut off!&#8221; screamed
Mrs. Brewster, &#8220;that it never shall! She has the most
beautiful hair, what is Janey&#8217;s compared to her&#8217;s?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You heard what I said,&#8221; he positively replied.</p>

<p>&#8220;But Mary Ann will not allow it to be done,&#8221; she returned,
shifting the ground of remonstrance from her
own shoulders, &#8220;and to do it in opposition would be
enough to kill her.&#8221; &#8220;It will not be done in opposition,&#8221;
he answered, &#8220;she will be unconscious before it is attempted.&#8221;
Mrs. Brewster&#8217;s heart sank within her. &#8220;You
anticipate she will be dangerously ill?&#8221; &#8220;In such cases
there is always danger, but worse cases than, as I
believe hers will be, are curable.&#8221; &#8220;If I lose her I
shall die myself;&#8221; she exclaimed, &#8220;and if she is to have
it badly she will die! Remember, doctor, how weak she
has always been.&#8221; &#8220;We sometimes find that the weak
of constitution battle best with an epidemic,&#8221; he replied,
&#8220;many a hearty one is stricken down with it and taken<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_14"></a>[14]</span>
off, many a sickly one has pulled through it and been the
better afterwards.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Everything shall be done as you wish,&#8221; said Mrs.
Brewster humbly in her great fear. &#8220;Very well. There
is one caution I would earnestly impress upon you, that
of keeping Janey from the sick-room.&#8221; &#8220;But there is
no one to whom Mary Ann is so accustomed as a nurse,&#8221;
objected Mrs. Brewster. &#8220;Madam,&#8221; burst forth the
doctor angrily, &#8220;would you subject Janey to the risk of
taking the infection in deference to Mary Ann&#8217;s selfishness
or to yours, better lose all the treasures your house
contains than lose Janey, she is the greatest treasure.&#8221;
&#8220;I know how remarkably prejudiced you have always
been in Janey&#8217;s favor,&#8221; spitefully spoke Mrs. Brewster.
&#8220;If I disliked her as much as I like her, I should be
equally solicitous to guard her from the danger of infection,&#8221;
said Doctor Brown. &#8220;If you chose to put Janey
out of consideration you cannot put Charles Taylor; in
justice to him she must be taken care of.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mrs. Brewster opened her mouth to reply, but closed
it again; strange words had been hovering upon her lips.
&#8220;If Charles Taylor had not been blind his choice would
have fallen upon Mary Ann, not upon Janey.&#8221; In her
heart there was a sore topic of resentment; for she fully
appreciated the advantages of a union with the Taylors.
Those words were swallowed down to give utterance to
others. &#8220;Janey is in the house, and therefore must be
liable to take the fever; whether she takes the infection<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_15"></a>[15]</span>
or not, I cannot fence her around with an air-tight wall so
that not a breath of tainted atmosphere shall touch her,
I would if I could, but I cannot.&#8221; &#8220;I would send her
from the house, Mrs. Brewster; at any rate, I would
forbid her to go near her sister; I don&#8217;t want two patients
on my hands instead of one,&#8221; he added in his quaint
fashion as he took his departure. He was about to step
into his buggy when he saw Charles Taylor advancing
with a quick step. &#8220;Which of them is it that is seized?&#8221;
he inquired as he came up. &#8220;Not Janey, thank goodness,&#8221;
replied the doctor. &#8220;It is Mary Ann; I have
been persuading the madam to send Janey from home;
I should send her were she a daughter of mine.&#8221; &#8220;Is
Mary Ann likely to have it dangerously?&#8221; &#8220;I think she
will. Is there any necessity for you going to the house
just now, Mr. Taylor?&#8221; Charles Taylor smiled. &#8220;There
is no necessity for my keeping away; I do not fear the
fever any more than you do.&#8221; He passed into the garden
as he spoke, and the doctor drove on. Janey saw him
and came running out. &#8220;Oh! Charles, don&#8217;t come in;
do not come.&#8221; His only answer was to take her upon
his arm and enter. He raised the drawing-room window,
that as much air might circulate through the house as
was possible, and stood at it with her holding her before
him. &#8220;Janey, what am I to do with you?&#8221; &#8220;To do
with me? What should you do with me, Charles?&#8221;
&#8220;Do you know, my dear, that I cannot afford to let this
danger touch you?&#8221; &#8220;I am not afraid,&#8221; she gently said.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_16"></a>[16]</span>
He knew that she had a brave unselfish heart, but he
was afraid for her, for he loved her with a jealous love,
jealous of any evil that might come too near her. &#8220;I
should like to take you out of the house with me now,
Janey. I should like to take you far from this fever-tainted
town; will you come?&#8221; She looked up at him
with a smile, the color coming into her cheeks. &#8220;How
could I, Charles?&#8221; Anxious thoughts were passing
through the mind of Charles Taylor. We cannot put
aside the conventionalities of life, though there are times
when they press upon us as an iron weight; he would
have given his own life almost to have taken Janey from
that house, but how was he to do it? No friend would
be likely to receive her; not even his own sisters; they
would have too much dread of the infection she might
bring. He would fain have carried her to some sea-breezed
town and watch over her and guard her there
until the danger should be over. None would have protected
her more honorably than Charles Taylor. But
those conventionalities the world has to bow down to,
how would the step have accorded with them? Another
thought passed through his mind. &#8220;Listen, Janey,&#8221; he
said, &#8220;suppose we get a license and drive to the parson&#8217;s
house; it could all be done in a few hours, and you could
be away with me before night.&#8221; As the meaning
dawned upon her, she bent her head, and her blushing
face, laughing at the wild improbability. &#8220;Oh! Charles,
you are only joking; what would people say?&#8221; &#8220;Would<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_17"></a>[17]</span>
it make any difference to us what they said?&#8221; &#8220;It
could not be, Charles; it is a vision impossible,&#8221; she replied
seriously. &#8220;Were all other things meet, how could
I run away from my sister on her bed of dangerous illness
to marry you?&#8221;</p>

<p>Janey was right and Charles Taylor felt that she was;
the conventionalities must be observed no matter at what
cost. He held her fondly against his heart, &#8220;if aught
of ill should arise to you from your remaining here I
should never forgive myself.&#8221; Charles could not remain
longer, he must be at his office, for business was
urging. His cousin, George Gay, was in the private
room alone when he entered, he appeared to be buried
five feet deep in business, though he would have
preferred to be five feet deep in pleasure. &#8220;Are
you going home to supper this evening?&#8221; inquired
Charles. &#8220;The fates permitting,&#8221; replied Mr. Gay,
&#8220;You tell my sisters that I will not return until after tea,
Mary will not thank me for running from Mrs. Brewster&#8217;s
house to hers, just now.&#8221; &#8220;Charles,&#8221; warmly spoke
George in an impulse of kindly feeling, &#8220;I do hope the
fever will not extend itself to Janey.&#8221; &#8220;I hope not,&#8221;
fervently breathed Charles Taylor.</p>

<small>THE RESIDENCE OF CHARLES TAYLOR.</small></h2></div>

<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/i_022.jpg" height="50" alt=""/>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">IN the heart of Bellville was situated the business house
of Bangs, Smith &amp; Taylor, built at the corner of a
street, it faced two ways, the office and its doors being on
L street, the principal street of the town. There was also
a dwelling-house on M street, a new short street not
much frequented. There were eight or ten houses on
this street all owned by the Taylors, and this street led
to the open country and to a carriage way that would
take you to the Taylor mansion. It was in one of these
houses that Charles Taylor had concluded to live after
his marriage with Janey Brewster, as it was near his business
and he wanted his sisters to live there with him as
it was their mother&#8217;s last request that they keep together,
but up to the present time he had never talked the matter
over with them. This house attached to the office
was a commodious one, its rooms were mostly large and
handsome and many in number, a pillared entrance to
which you ascended by steps took you into a large hall,
on the right of this hall was a room used for a dining-room,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_19"></a>[19]</span>
a light and spacious apartment, its large window
opening on a covered terrace where plants could be kept
and that again standing open to a sloping lawn surrounded
with shrubs and flowers. On the left of the
hall was a kitchen, pantries and such like, at the
back of the hall beyond the dining-room a handsome
staircase led to the apartments, one of which was a fine
drawing-room. From the upper windows at the back
of the house a full view of the Taylor mansion might be
obtained, rising high and picturesque, also the steeple of
a cathedral gray and grim, not of the cathedral itself,
its surrounding trees concealed that.</p>

<p>In the dining-room of the Taylor mansion one evening
sat Charles Taylor and his eldest sister, Mary. This room
was elegant and airy and fitted up with exquisite taste; it
was the ladies&#8217; favorite sitting-room. The drawing-room
above was larger and grander but less used by them.
On the evening in question, Charles Taylor was arranging
plans for a business trip with his sister, though her
removal to town was uppermost in his mind. About ten
days previous to this, Marshall Bangs, one of the partners,
had been found insensible on the floor of his room;
he was subject to attacks of heart-disease, and this had
proved to be nothing but a fainting spell, but it had
caused plans to be somewhat changed, for Mr. Bangs
would not be strong enough for business consultation,
which would have been the chief object of his journey.
As I said before, Charles and his sister were sitting<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_20"></a>[20]</span>
alone, their cousin, George Gay, had gone out for a
walk and Martha was spending the evening at Parson
Davis&#8217;, for she and Mrs. Davis were active workers in
church affairs. The dessert was on the table, but
Charles had turned from it and was sitting opposite the
fireplace. Miss Taylor sat opposite him, nearer the
table, her fingers busy with knitting, on which fell the
rays of the chandelier. &#8220;Mary,&#8221; said Charles, earnestly,
&#8220;I wish that you would let me bring Janey here on a visit
to you.&#8221; Mary laid down her knitting. &#8220;What, do
you mean that there should be two mistresses in the
house, she and I? No, Charles, the daftest old wife in
all the world would tell you that would not do.&#8221; &#8220;Not
two mistresses; you would be sole mistress, as you are
now; Janey and I your guests, indeed Mary, it would
be the best plan. Suppose we all move to town together,&#8221;
he said. &#8220;It was mother&#8217;s desire that we
should remain together.&#8221; &#8220;No, Charles, it would not do;
some of the partners have always resided near the office,
and it is necessary, in my opinion, that you should let
business men be at their business. When do you contemplate
marrying Janey,&#8221; she inquired, after a few minutes
of thought. &#8220;I should like her to be mine by
Thanksgiving,&#8221; was the low answer. &#8220;Charles! and
November close upon us.&#8221; &#8220;If not, some time in December,&#8221;
he continued, paying no heed to her surprise.
&#8220;It is so decided.&#8221; Miss Taylor drew a long breath.
&#8220;With whom is it decided?&#8221; &#8220;With Janey.&#8221; &#8220;You<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_21"></a>[21]</span>
marry a wife without a home to bring her too; had cousin
George told me that he was going to do such a thing I
would have believed him, not of you, Charles!&#8221; &#8220;Mary,
the home shall no longer be a barrier. I wish you would
receive Janey here as your guest.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is not likely that she would come; the first thing
a married woman looks out for is a home of her own.&#8221;</p>

<p>Charles laughed. &#8220;Not come? Mary, have you yet
to learn how unassuming and meek is the character of
Janey? We have spoken of this plan together, and
Janey&#8217;s only fear is lest she should be in the way of
Miss Taylor failing in the carrying out of this project.
Mary (for I see you are as I thought you would be,
prejudiced against it) I shall take one of the houses near
the office in town and there I shall take Janey. The
pleasantest plan would be for me to bring Janey here,
entirely as your guest; it is what she and I would both
like. If you object, I shall take her elsewhere.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mary knitted a whole row before she spoke. &#8220;I will
take a few days to reflect upon it, Charles,&#8221; she said.
&#8220;Do so,&#8221; he replied, rising and glancing at his watch.
&#8220;Half past eight. What time will Martha expect me?
I wish to spend half an hour with Janey, shall I go for
Martha before or afterwards?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Go for her at once, Charles; it will be better for her
to be home early.&#8221;</p>

<p>Charles Taylor went to the hall door and looked out
upon the night; he was considering whether he need put<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_22"></a>[22]</span>
on an overcoat. It was a bright moonlight night, pleasant
and genial, so he closed the door and started. &#8220;I
wish the cold would come,&#8221; he exclaimed half aloud; he
was thinking of the fever which still clung to Bellville,
showing itself fitfully and partially in fresh places
about every three or four days. He took the path leading
to L. street, a lonely road and at night unfrequented;
the pathway was so narrow that two people could
scarcely walk abreast without touching the trunks of the
maple trees growing on either side and meeting overhead.
Charles Taylor went steadily on, his thoughts
running upon the subject of his conversation with Mary.</p>

<p>It is probable that but for the difficulty touching a residence,
Janey would have been his the past summer.
Altogether, Charles&#8217; plan was the best, if Mary could be
brought to see it, that his young bride should be her
guest for a short time. Charles, in due course of time,
arrived at the walk&#8217;s end and passed through a large
gate. The town lay in front of him, gray and sombre,
as it was nearly hidden by trees; he looked at it fondly,
his heart yearned to it, for it was to be the future home
of Janey and himself.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hello! who&#8217;s there? Oh, I beg your pardon, Mr
Taylor.&#8221;</p>

<p>The speaker was Doctor Brown. He had come swiftly
upon Charles Taylor, turning from the corner around
the maple trees; that he had been to see the sick was
certain, but Charles had not heard of any one being sick<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_23"></a>[23]</span>
in that direction. &#8220;Neither had I,&#8221; said the doctor, in
answer to the remark, &#8220;until I was sent for an hour ago
in haste.&#8221; A thought crossed Charlie&#8217;s mind, &#8220;Not a
case of fever, I hope.&#8221; &#8220;No; I think that&#8217;s leaving
us. There&#8217;s been an accident to the parson&#8217;s wife&mdash;at
least what might have been an accident, I should
rather say,&#8221; added the doctor, correcting himself;
&#8220;the injury is so slight as not to be worth the name of
one.&#8221; &#8220;What has happened?&#8221; asked Charles Taylor.
&#8220;She managed to set her sleeve on fire. A muslin,
falling over the merino sleeve of her gown, in
standing near a candle, the flame caught it; but just
look at her presence of mind! Instead of wasting
time running through the house from top to bottom,
as most of them would have done, she instantly threw
herself down on the rug and rolled herself into it.
She&#8217;s the kind of a woman to go through life.&#8221; &#8220;Is
she much burnt?&#8221; &#8220;No; many a child gets more burnt
a dozen times in its first dozen years. The arm, between
the elbow and wrist, is a little scorched; it&#8217;s nothing;
they need not have sent for me; a drop of cold water
applied will take out all the fire. Your sister Martha
was much more frightened than she was.&#8221; &#8220;I&#8217;m really
glad it&#8217;s no worse,&#8221; said Charles Taylor. &#8220;I feared the
fever might have broken out again.&#8221; &#8220;That is taking
its departure, I think, and the sooner it&#8217;s gone the better;
it has been capricious as a coquette&#8217;s smiles; it is strange
that in many houses it should have attacked only one<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_24"></a>[24]</span>
inmate and spared the rest.&#8221; &#8220;What do you think,
now, of Mary Ann Brewster?&#8221; The doctor shook his
head, and his voice grew insensibly low. &#8220;In my
opinion, she is sinking fast. I found her worse this
afternoon, weaker than she has been at all; her mother
thought that if she could get her to Newtown she
might improve; but the removal would kill her; she
would die on the road. It will be a terrible blow to her
mother if it does come; and, though it may be harsh to
say it, a retort upon her selfishness. Did you hear that
she used to make Janey head nurse while the fever was
upon her?&#8221; &#8220;No,&#8221; exclaimed Charles Taylor. &#8220;They
did, though; Mrs. Brewster let it out to-day unintentionally.
Dear girl! if she had caught it, I should never
have forgiven her mother, whatever you may have
done. I have a few more visits to make now before
bedtime. Good-night!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Worse!&#8221; exclaimed Charles, as he walked on, &#8220;poor
Mary Ann, but I wonder&#8221;&mdash;he hesitated as the thought
struck him whether if the worse should come, as the
doctor seems to anticipate, if it would delay Janey&#8217;s marriage,
what with one delay and another. He walked on
to the parson&#8217;s house where he found Mrs. Davis, playing
the invalid, lying on a sofa, her auburn hair was disheveled,
her cheeks flushed; the burnt arm, her muslin
sleeve pinned up, was stretched out on a cushion, a
pocket handkerchief, saturated with water, resting
lightly on the burns, a basin of water stood near with<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_25"></a>[25]</span>
another handkerchief in it, and the maid was near to exchange
the handkerchiefs as might be required. Charles
Taylor drew his chair near to Mrs. Davis and listened to
the account of the accident, giving her his full sympathy,
for it might have been a bad one. &#8220;You must possess
great presence of mind,&#8221; he observed. &#8220;I think your
showing it, as you have done in this instance, has won
the doctor&#8217;s heart.&#8221; Mrs. Davis smiled. &#8220;I believe I
do possess presence of mind; once we were riding out
with some friends in a carriage when the horses took
fright, ran away, and nearly tore the carriage to pieces;
while all were frightened in a fearful manner I remained
calm and cool.&#8221; &#8220;It is a good thing for you,&#8221; he observed.
&#8220;I suppose it is; better at any rate than to go
mad with fear, as some do. Martha has had enough
fright to last her for a year.&#8221; &#8220;What were you doing,
Martha?&#8221; asked her brother. &#8220;I was present but I did
not see it,&#8221; replied Martha; &#8220;it occurred in her room,
and I was in the hall looking out of the window with
my back to her; the first I knew or saw, Mrs. Davis
was lying on the floor with the rug rolled around her.&#8221;
Tea was brought in and Mrs. Davis insisted that they
should remain to it. Charles pleaded an engagement
but she would not listen; they could not have the heart
to leave her alone, so Charles, the very essence of good
feeling and politeness, remained. Tea having been over,
Martha went upstairs to get her wraps. Mrs. Davis
turned her head as the door was closed and then spoke<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_26"></a>[26]</span>
abruptly: &#8220;I am glad that Mr. Davis was not here, he
would have magnified it into something formidable, and
I should not have been let stir for a month.&#8221; The door
opened, Martha appeared, they wished Mrs. Davis
&#8220;good night,&#8221; a speedy cure from her burns, and departed,
Charles, taking the straight path this time, which
did not lead them near the maple trees. &#8220;How quaint
old Doctor Brown is,&#8221; said Martha, as they walked along;
&#8220;when he had looked at Mrs. Davis&#8217; arm he made a
great parade of getting out his glasses and putting them
on, and looking again.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you call it, a burn?&#8221; he asked her. &#8220;It is
a burn, is it not,&#8221; she answered, looking at him. &#8220;No,&#8221;
said he, &#8220;its nothing but a singe,&#8221; it made her laugh
heartily. &#8220;I guess she was pleased to have escaped with
such slight damage.&#8221; &#8220;That is just like Doctor Brown,&#8221;
said Charles.</p>

<p>Having arrived at home, Miss Taylor was in the same
place knitting still; it was half past ten, too late for
Charles to pay a visit to Mrs. Brewster. &#8220;Mary, I fear
you have waited tea for us,&#8221; said Martha. &#8220;To be sure
child, I expected you home to it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Martha explained why she did not come, telling of the
accident to Mrs. Davis. &#8220;Ah, careless! careless! careless!
she might have been burned to death,&#8221; said Mary,
lifting her hands. &#8220;She would have been much more
burnt had it not been for her presence of mind,&#8221; said
Charles slowly. Miss Taylor laid down her knitting and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_27"></a>[27]</span>
approached the tea-table, none must preside at the meals
but herself. She inquired of Charles whether he was
going out again. &#8220;I think not,&#8221; he replied indecisively,
&#8220;I should like to have gone though, the doctor tells me
Mary Ann Brewster is worse.&#8221; &#8220;Weaker I conclude,&#8221;
said Mary. &#8220;Weaker than she has been at all, he thinks
there is no hope for her now. No, I will not disturb
them,&#8221; he positively added, &#8220;it would be nearly twelve
by the time I reached there.&#8221;</p>

<small>CHARLES TAYLOR RECEIVES A MESSAGE.</small></h2></div>

<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/i_032.jpg" height="50" alt=""/>
</div>


<p class="drop-cap">WHAT a loud ring,&#8221; exclaimed Mary Taylor, as the
bell, pulled with no gentle hand, echoed and
echoed through the house; &#8220;should it be cousin George
come home, he thinks he will let us know who is there.&#8221;
It was not George. A servant entered the room with a
telegram, &#8220;the man is waiting, sir,&#8221; he said, holding out
the paper for Charles to sign. Charles affixed his signature
and took up the dispatch; it came from Waterville,
Mary laid her hand upon it ere it was open, her
face looked ghastly pale. &#8220;A moment of preparation,&#8221;
she said. &#8220;Now, Mary, do not anticipate evil, it may
not be ill news at all.&#8221; He glanced his eye rapidly and
privately over it while Martha came and stood near with
a stifled sob, then he held it out to Mary, reading it aloud
at the same time, &#8220;Mrs. Bangs to Charles Taylor, come
at once to Waterville, Mr. Bangs wishes to see you.&#8221;
Mary, her extreme fears having been relieved, took
refuge in displeasure. &#8220;What does Mrs. Bangs mean
by sending a vague message like that?&#8221; she uttered.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_29"></a>[29]</span>
&#8220;Is Mr. Bangs worse, is he sick, is he in danger or
has the summons not reference at all to his state of
health?&#8221; Charles had taken it in his hand again and
was studying the words&mdash;as we are all apt to do when
in uncertainty.</p>

<p>He could make no more out of them. &#8220;Mrs. Bangs
might have been more explicit,&#8221; he resumed. &#8220;She has
no right to play upon our fears,&#8221; said Mary. &#8220;Well, what
are you going to do?&#8221; inquired Mary of her brother.
&#8220;I will do as the dispatch desires me, go at once, which
will be at midnight.&#8221; &#8220;Give it to me again,&#8221; said Mary.
He put the dispatch into her hand, and she sat down
with it, apparently studying its every word. &#8220;Vague!
Vague! Can anything be possibly more vague,&#8221; she
exclaimed. &#8220;It leaves us utterly in doubt of her motive
for sending, she must have done it on purpose to try our
feelings.&#8221; &#8220;She has done it in carelessness, carelessness,&#8221;
surmised Charles. &#8220;Which is as reprehensible as the
other,&#8221; severely answered Mary. &#8220;Charles, when you
get there, should you find him dangerously ill dispatch
to us at once.&#8221; &#8220;I should be sure to do so,&#8221; was his
answer. &#8220;Where are you going?&#8221; asked Mary, for he
was preparing to go out. &#8220;As far as Mrs. Brewster&#8217;s.&#8221;
Leaving the warm room for the street, the night air
seemed to strike upon him with a chill which he had not
experienced when he went out previously, and he returned
and put on his overcoat. He could not leave
before 2 o&#8217;clock, unless he had engaged a special train,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_30"></a>[30]</span>
which the circumstances did not appear to call for. At
2 o&#8217;clock a mail train passed through the place, stopping
at all stations, and on that he concluded to go. He
walked briskly along the path, his thoughts running upon
many things, but chiefly on the unsatisfactory dispatch,
very unsatisfactory he felt it to be, and a vague fear
crossed his mind that his friend and partner might be in
danger, looking at it from a sober point of view his
judgment said &#8220;no,&#8221; but we cannot always look at suspense
soberly, neither could Charles Taylor.</p>

<p>Before reaching Madam Brewster&#8217;s on the walk that
Charles had taken, you pass the church and residence of
Parson Davis. Nature had not intended Mr. Davis for
a pastor, and his sermons were the bane of his life; an
excellent man, a most efficient pastor for a village, a
gentleman, a scholar, abounding in good, practical sense,
but not a preacher; sometimes he wrote sermons, sometimes
he tried them without the book, but let him do
as he would, there was always a conviction of failure as
to his sermons winning their way to his hearers hearts.
He was of medium height, keen features, black hair,
mingled with gray. The house was built of white stone
and was a commodious residence; some of the rooms had
been added to the house of late years. Mrs. Davis&#8217;
room was very pleasant to sit in on a summer&#8217;s day
when the grass was green and the many colored flowers
with their gay brightness and their perfume gladdened
the senses, and the birds were singing and the bees and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_31"></a>[31]</span>
butterflies sporting. Mrs. Davis was a lady-like woman
of middle height and fair complexion, she was remarkably
susceptible to surrounding influences, seasons and
weather held much power over her. A dark figure
was leaning over the gate of Parson Davis, shaded by
the dark trees, but though the features of the face were
obscure, the outline of the clerical hat was visible, and
by that Mr. Davis was known. Charles Taylor stopped:
&#8220;You are going this way late&#8221; said the parson. &#8220;It is
late for a visit to Mrs. Brewster&#8217;s, but I wish particularly
to see them.&#8221; &#8220;I have just returned from there,&#8221; said
Mr. Davis. &#8220;Mary Ann grows weaker, I hear.&#8221; &#8220;Yes,
I have been holding prayer with her.&#8221; Charles Taylor
felt shocked. &#8220;Is she so near death as that,&#8221; he inquired
in a hushed tone. &#8220;So near death as that&#8221; repeated
Mr. Davis in an accent of reproof. &#8220;I did not
expect to hear such a remark from you, Mr. Taylor; my
friend, is it only when death is near that we are to pray?&#8221;
&#8220;It is mostly when death is near that prayers are held
over us,&#8221; replied Charles Taylor. &#8220;True, for those who
have known when and how to pray for themselves; look
at that girl passing away from among us, with all her
worldly thoughts, her selfish habits, her evil, peevish
temper, but God&#8217;s ways are not like our ways; we might
be tempted to ask why such as these are removed, such
as Janey left, the one child as near akin to an angel as it
is possible to be here; the other, in our blind judgment,
we may wonder that she, most ripe for heaven, should<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_32"></a>[32]</span>
not be taken to it, and the other one left to be pruned
and dug around, to have, in short, a chance given her of
making herself better.&#8221; &#8220;Is she so very sick?&#8221; &#8220;I
think her so, as well as the doctor, it was what he said
that sent me up; her frame of mind is not a desirable
one, and I have been doing my best; I shall be with her
again to-morrow.&#8221; He continued his way and Mr. Davis
looked after him until his form disappeared in the
shadows cast by the roadside trees. The clock was
striking twelve when Charles Taylor opened the iron
gate that led to Mrs. Brewster&#8217;s house; the house, with
the exception of one window looked dark, even the hall
lamp was out and he was afraid that all had retired.
From that window a dull light shone behind the blind; a
stationary light it had been of late, to be seen by any
wayfarer all night long for it came from the sick girl&#8217;s
room. A rap upon the door brought Eliza.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, sir,&#8221; she exclaimed in surprise of seeing him so
late, &#8220;I think Miss Janey has gone to bed.&#8221; Mrs. Brewster
came running down the stairs as he stepped into the
hall; she also was surprised at his late visit. &#8220;I would
not have disturbed you, but I am about to depart for
Waterville,&#8221; he explained. &#8220;A telegram has arrived
from Mrs. Bangs, calling me there. I should like to see
Janey before I go. I don&#8217;t know how long I may be
gone.&#8221; &#8220;I sent Janey to her bed, her head ached,&#8221; said
Mrs. Brewster, &#8220;she has not been up very long. Oh,
Mr. Taylor, this has been such a day of grief, heads and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_33"></a>[33]</span>
and hearts alike aching.&#8221; Charles Taylor entered the
drawing-room, and Mrs. Brewster proceeded to her
daughter&#8217;s chamber; softly opening the door, she looked
in. Janey, undisturbed by the noise of his visit, for she
had not supposed it to be a visit relating to her, was
kneeling down by the bed saying her prayers, her face
buried in her hands, and the light from the candle shining
on her smooth hair. A minute or so her mother remained
silent, and then Janey arose; she had not begun
to undress. It was the first intimation she had that anyone
was there, and she recoiled with surprise. &#8220;Mamma,
how you scared me! Mary Ann is not worse?&#8221; &#8220;She
can&#8217;t well be worse on this side of the grave. Mr.
Taylor is in the drawing-room, and wishes to see you.&#8221;
She went down at once. Mrs. Brewster did not go
with her, but went into her sick daughter&#8217;s room. The
fire in the drawing-room was low, and Eliza had been
in to stir it up. Charles stood before it with Janey, telling
her of his unexpected journey. The red embers
threw a glow upon her face, her brow looked heavy,
her eyes swollen. He saw the signs, and laid his hand
fondly on her head. &#8220;What has given you the headache,
Janey?&#8221; The tears came into her eyes. &#8220;It does
ache very much,&#8221; she answered. &#8220;Has crying caused
it?&#8221; &#8220;Yes,&#8221; she said, &#8220;it is of no use to deny it, for
you could have seen it by my swollen eyelids. I
have wept to-day until it seems I can weep no
longer, and it has made my eyes ache and my heart<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_34"></a>[34]</span>
dull and heavy.&#8221; &#8220;But, my dear, you should not
give way to this grief; it may render you seriously
ill.&#8221; &#8220;Oh, Charles, how can I help it,&#8221; she replied with
emotion, as the tears rolled swiftly down her cheeks.</p>

<p>&#8220;We begin to see that there is no hope of Mary
Ann&#8217;s recovery; the doctor told mamma so to-day, and
he sent over Mr. Davis.&#8221; &#8220;Will grieving alter it?&#8221;
Janey wept silently; there was full and complete confidence
between her and Charles Taylor. She could tell
him all her thoughts, her troubles, as she could a mother
if she had one that loved her. &#8220;If she was more ready
to go, the pain would seem less,&#8221; breathed Janey. &#8220;That
is, we might feel more reconciled to losing her, but you
know how she is, Charles, when I have tried to talk to
her about Heaven, she would not listen. She said it
made her dull; it gave her the horrors. How can she,
who has never thought of God, be fit to meet him?&#8221;
Janey&#8217;s tears were deepening into sobs. Charles Taylor
thought of what the minister had said to him. His
hand still rested on the head of Janey. &#8220;You are fit to
meet him,&#8221; he exclaimed, sadly. &#8220;Janey, what makes
such a difference between you, you are sisters, raised in
the same home?&#8221; &#8220;I do not know,&#8221; said Janey, slowly,
&#8220;I have always thought a great deal about Heaven ever
since I first went to Sunday-school.&#8221; &#8220;And why not
Mary Ann?&#8221; &#8220;She would not go; she liked balls, parties
and such like.&#8221; Charles smiled; the words were so
simple and natural. &#8220;Had the summons gone forth for<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_35"></a>[35]</span>
you instead of her, it would have brought you no dismay?&#8221;
&#8220;Only that I must leave all of my friends behind
me,&#8221; she answered, looking up at him, a bright smile shining
through her tears. &#8220;I should know that God would
not take me unless it was for the best. Oh, Charles, if we
could only save her!&#8221; &#8220;Child, you contradict yourself.
If what God does must be for the best, you should reconcile
yourself to parting with Mary Ann.&#8221; &#8220;Yes,&#8221;
hesitated Janey, &#8220;but I fear she has never thought of it
herself or in any way prepared for it.&#8221; &#8220;Do you know
that I am going to find fault with you, Janey?&#8221; he added,
after a pause. She turned her eyes upon him in complete
surprise, the tears drying up. &#8220;Did you not promise
me&mdash;did you not promise the doctor that you would
not enter your sister&#8217;s chamber while the fever was upon
her?&#8221; The hot color flashed into her face. &#8220;Forgive
me, Charles,&#8221; she whispered, &#8220;I could not help myself;
Mary Ann, on the fifth morning of her illness, began to
cry for me very much, and mamma came to my room
and asked me to go to her. I told her that the doctor
had forbidden me and that I had promised you; it made
her angry; she took me by the arm and pulled me in.&#8221;
Charles stood looking at her; there was nothing to answer.
He had known in his deep and trusting love that
it was no fault of Janey&#8217;s. Thinking he was vexed, she
answered, &#8220;You know, Charles, so long as I am here in
mamma&#8217;s home, her child, it is to her that I owe obedience;
as soon as I am your wife I shall owe it and give<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_36"></a>[36]</span>
it to you.&#8221; &#8220;You are right, my darling.&#8221; &#8220;And it has
been productive of no ill consequences,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I
did not catch the fever; had I found myself growing the
least sick, I should have sent for you and told you
all.&#8221; &#8220;Janey,&#8221; he cried, &#8220;had you caught the fever I
should never have forgiven those who led you into the
danger.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Listen,&#8221; said Janey, &#8220;mamma is calling.&#8221; Mrs.
Brewster had been calling to Mr. Taylor. Thinking that
she was not heard she came down the stairs and entered
the room wringing her hands; her eyes were moist, her
sharp thin red nose was redder then ever. &#8220;Oh, dear,
I don&#8217;t know what I shall do with her,&#8221; she sobbed.
&#8220;She is so sick and fretful, Mr. Taylor, nothing will satisfy
her now but she must see you.&#8221; &#8220;See me,&#8221; repeated
he. &#8220;She will,&#8221; she says. &#8220;I told her you was leaving
for Waterville and she burst out crying and said if
she was to die she would never see you again, do you
mind going in, you are not afraid?&#8221; &#8220;No, I am not
afraid,&#8221; said Charles, &#8220;the infection can not have remained
all this while, and if it had I should not fear it.&#8221;
Mrs. Brewster led the way upstairs, Charles followed
her, Janey came in afterwards. Mary Ann lay in bed,
her thin face, drawn and white, raised upon the pillow,
her hollow eyes were strained forward with a fixed look.
Sick as he had thought her to have been he was hardly
prepared to see her like this; and it shocked him. &#8220;Why
have you never come to see me?&#8221; she asked in a hollow<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_37"></a>[37]</span>
voice as he approached and leaned over her, &#8220;you
would never have come till I died, you only care for
Janey.&#8221; &#8220;I would have come to see you had I known
you wished it,&#8221; he answered, &#8220;but you do not look
strong enough to receive visitors.&#8221; &#8220;They might cure
me if they would,&#8221; she said, her breath panting, &#8220;I want
to go away somewhere and that Brown won&#8217;t let me; if
it were Janey he would cure her.&#8221; &#8220;He will let you go
as soon as you are able,&#8221; said Charles. &#8220;Why did this
fever come to me, why didn&#8217;t it go to Janey instead, she
is strong and would have got well in no time, that is not
fair.&#8221; &#8220;My dear child you must not excite yourself,&#8221; implored
her mother. &#8220;I will speak,&#8221; cried Mary Ann with
a touch, feeble though it was, of her peevish vehemence.
&#8220;Nobody&#8217;s thought of but Janey, if you had your way,&#8221;
looking hard at Mr. Taylor, &#8220;she would not have been
allowed to come near me, no, not if I had died.&#8221; She
altered into whimpering tears, her mother whispered
to him to leave the room, it would not do, this excitement.
&#8220;I will come and see you again when you are
better,&#8221; he soothingly whispered. &#8220;No, you won&#8217;t,&#8221;
said Mary Ann, &#8220;and I shall be dead when you return,
good-by, Charles Taylor.&#8221; These last words were called
after him as he left the room, her mother went with him
to the door, her eyes full, &#8220;you see there is no hope of
her,&#8221; she wailed. Charles did not think there was, it
appeared to him that in a few hours, hope for Mary Ann
would be over. Janey waited for him in the hall and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_38"></a>[38]</span>
was leading the way to the drawing-room, but he told
her that he could not stay longer and opened the door.
&#8220;I wish you were not going away,&#8221; she said, her spirits
being very unequal caused her to see things with a
gloomy eye. &#8220;I wish you were going with me,&#8221; said
he, &#8220;don&#8217;t cry, I shall soon be back again.&#8221; &#8220;Everything
makes me cry to-night, you might not get back
until the worst is over, oh, if she could be saved.&#8221; He
held her face close to him and took from it his farewell
kiss. &#8220;God bless you, my darling, forever.&#8221; &#8220;May he
bless you Charles,&#8221; she said, with streaming eyes and
for the first time in her life his kiss was returned, then
they parted.</p>

<p class="drop-cap">CHARLES having reached the station, taken the train
to Waterville in response to the telegram, and
when he reached there taken a carriage and was driven
to the residence of Marshall Bangs, he found the decaying
invalid sitting on a sofa in his bed-room; he had just
recovered from a fainting spell, and he had recovered
only to be the more weak. He was standing on the
lawn before his house talking with a friend when he
suddenly fell to the ground. He did not recover consciousness
until evening, and nearly the first wish he
expressed was a desire to see his friend and partner,
Charles Taylor. &#8220;Dispatch for him&#8221; he said to his wife.
Mrs. Bangs had a horror for fevers, especially when they
were confined to everybody; at the present time she
considered herself out of the reach of it, and no amount
of persuasion could induce her to return, but her husband
had grown tired and restless and was determined to go
home, but let her remain until the fever had taken its
departure, hence the dispatch. On the second day he<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_40"></a>[40]</span>
was well enough to converse with Charles on business
affairs, and that over, he expressed the wish that Charles
would take him home. Charles mentioned it to Mrs.
Bangs; it did not meet her approbation. &#8220;You should
have opposed it entirely,&#8221; she said, in a firm tone.
&#8220;But why so, Mrs. Bangs, if he desires to return, I think
he should.&#8221; &#8220;Not while the fever lingers there; were he
to take it and die I should never forgive myself.&#8221;
Charles had no fear of the fever for himself, and did not
fear it for his friend; he intimated as much, &#8220;it is not
the fever that will hurt him, Mrs. Bangs.&#8221; &#8220;You have
no right to say that. Mrs. Brewster, a month ago, would
have said that she did not fear it for Mary Ann, and now
she is dying, or dead, you confess you did not think that
she could last more than a day or two when you left.&#8221;
&#8220;I certainly did not,&#8221; said Charles. &#8220;She looked fearfully
ill and emaciated, but that has nothing to do with
Mr. Bangs.&#8221; &#8220;I cannot conceive how you could be so
imprudent as to venture into her sick-room,&#8221; cried Mrs.
Bangs, &#8220;indeed that you went to the house at all while
the fever was in it.&#8221; &#8220;There could be no risk in my
going into her room, nothing is the matter with her now
but debility.&#8221; &#8220;We cannot tell, Mr. Taylor, when risk
ends or when it begins; had not so many hours elapsed
before you came here I should feel afraid of you.&#8221;
Charles smiled. But he wished he had said nothing of
his visit to the sick-room, for he was one of those who
observe strict consideration for the feelings and prejudices<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_41"></a>[41]</span>
of others; there was no help for it now. &#8220;It is not I
that shall be returning to Bellville yet,&#8221; said Mrs. Bangs,
&#8220;the sickly old place must give proof of its renewed
health first; you will not get either me nor Mr. Bangs there
for quite a while.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What does the doctor think of the fever, that it will
linger long?&#8221; &#8220;On the night I came away he told me he
believed it was going at last. I hope he will prove right.&#8221;</p>

<p>Charles Taylor spoke to his partner of his marriage
arrangements. He had received a letter from Mary
the morning after he left, in which she agreed to the proposal
that Janey should be her temporary guest. This
removed all barriers to the immediate union. &#8220;But,
Charles, suppose Mary Ann should die,&#8221; observed Mr.
Bangs. This conversation was taking place on the day
previous to their leaving Waterville, where Charles had
now been three days. &#8220;In that case, I suppose it will
have to be postponed,&#8221; he replied, &#8220;but I hope for better
news. That she is not dead yet is certain, or they
would have written to me, and in such cases, if a patient
can pull through the first debility, recovery may be possible.&#8221;
&#8220;Have you heard from Janey?&#8221; &#8220;No. I have
written to her twice, but in each letter I told her I would
soon be home; therefore, most likely she did not write,
thinking it would miss me. Had the worst happened,
they would have written to me at all events.&#8221; &#8220;So you
will marry soon, if she lives?&#8221; &#8220;Very soon.&#8221; &#8220;I hope
that God will bless you both,&#8221; cried the invalid. &#8220;She<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_42"></a>[42]</span>
will be a wife in a thousand.&#8221; Charles thought she
would, but did not say so. &#8220;I wish I had never left
Bellville,&#8221; he said, turning his haggard, but still fine blue
eyes upon his friend. Charles was silent. None had
regretted the departure more than he. &#8220;I wish I could
go back to it to die.&#8221; &#8220;My dear friend, I hope you may
live many years to bless us. If you can get through
the winter, and I see no reason why you should not, with
care, you may regain your strength and be as well as
ever.&#8221; The invalid shook his head. &#8220;It will never be.&#8221;
While they were thus engaged a servant called Charles
from the room. A telegram had arrived for him at the
station, and a boy had brought it over. A conviction of
what it contained flashed over Charles Taylor&#8217;s heart as
he opened it; the death of Mary Ann Brewster. From
Mrs. Brewster it proved to be, not much more satisfactory
than Mrs. Bangs, for if hers was unexplanatory this
was incoherent. &#8220;The breath has just left my daughter&#8217;s
body. Mrs. Brewster.&#8221; Charles returned to the
room, his mind full; in the midst of his sorrow and regret
for Mary Ann, his compassion for her mother, and
he did really feel sorry, intruded the thoughts of his
marriage; it must be postponed now. &#8220;What did he
want with you,&#8221; asked Mr. Bangs when Charles returned
to him. &#8220;He brought me a telegram from Bellville.&#8221;
&#8220;A business message?&#8221; &#8220;No, sir; from Mrs. Brewster.&#8221;
By the tone of his voice, by the falling of his countenance,
he could read what had occurred, but he kept<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_43"></a>[43]</span>
silent, waiting for him to speak. &#8220;Poor Mary Ann is
gone.&#8221; &#8220;It will make a delay in your plans, Charles,&#8221;
said Mr. Bangs sorrowfully, after some minutes had been
given to expressions of regret. &#8220;It will, sir.&#8221; The invalid
leaned back in his chair, and said in a low voice,
&#8220;I shall not be long after her, I feel that I shall not.&#8221;</p>

<p>Very early indeed did they start in the morning, long
before daybreak. They would reach Bellville at twelve
at night, all things being well; a weary day, a long one
at any rate, and the train steamed into Bellville. The
clock was striking twelve. Mr. Bangs&#8217; carriage stood
waiting. A few minutes was spent in collecting baggage.
&#8220;Shall I give you a seat as far as the bank, Mr. Taylor?&#8221;
inquired Mr. Bangs. &#8220;Thank you; no I shall just go
for a minute&#8217;s call on Mrs. Brewster.&#8221; Mr. Davis who
was in the station getting mail heard the words, he
turned hastily, caught Charles by the hand and drew
him aside. &#8220;Are you aware of what has happened?&#8221;
&#8220;Yes,&#8221; replied Charles, &#8220;Mrs. Brewster telegraphed to
me last night.&#8221; Mr. Davis pressed his hand and moved
on, Charles taking the road that would lead him to
Mrs. Brewster&#8217;s house. It is now ten days since he was
there, the house looked precisely as it did then, all in
darkness, except the dull light that burned from Mary
Ann&#8217;s sick room; it burnt there still; then it was lighting
the living; now&mdash;Charles Taylor rang the bell
gently, does any one like to go with a fierce peal to a
house where death is an inmate? Eliza opened the door<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_44"></a>[44]</span>
as usual and burst into tears when she saw who it was.
&#8220;I said it would bring you back, sir!&#8221; she exclaimed.
&#8220;Does Mrs. Brewster bear it pretty well,&#8221; he asked, as
she showed him into the drawing-room. &#8220;No, sir; not
over well,&#8221; sobbed the girl. &#8220;I&#8217;ll tell the mistress that
you are here.&#8221; He stood over the fire as he had done
before, it was low now like it was then, strangely still
seemed the house, he could almost have told that one
was lying dead in it, he listened waiting for the step of
Janey, hoping that she would be the first to meet him.
Eliza returned. &#8220;My mistress says, would you be kind
enough to come to her.&#8221; Charles followed her upstairs,
she went to the room where he had been taken
the other time, Mary Ann&#8217;s room, in reality the room of
Mrs. Brewster; but it had been given to Mary Ann for
her sickness. Eliza with soft tread crossed the corridor
to the door and opened it. Was she going to show him
into the presence of the dead. He thought she must
have mistaken Mrs. Brewster&#8217;s orders and he hesitated
on the threshhold. &#8220;Where is Miss Janey,&#8221; he whispered.
&#8220;Who, sir;&#8221; &#8220;Miss Janey, is she well?&#8221; The girl
stared at him, flung the door wide open and gave a loud
cry as she flew down the stairs. He looked after her in
amazement, had she gone mad, then he turned and walked
into the room with a hesitating step. Mrs. Brewster
was coming forward to meet him, she was convulsed with
grief, he took both her hands in his with a soothing gesture,
essaying a word of comfort, not of inquiry why she<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_45"></a>[45]</span>
should have brought him to this room, he glanced at the
bed expecting to see the corpse upon it; but the bed was
empty and at that moment his eyes caught another sight.</p>

<p>Seated by the fire in an invalid chair surrounded by
pillows covered with shawls, with a wan, attenuated
face and eyes that seemed to have a glaze over them
was&mdash;who? Mary Ann? It certainly was Mary Ann,
in life yet, for she feebly held out her hand in welcome,
and the tears suddenly gushed from her eyes, &#8220;I am
getting better, Mr. Taylor.&#8221; Charles Taylor&mdash;how shall
I write it, for one minute he was blind to what it could
all mean, his whole mind was a chaos of astonished perplexity,
and then when the dreadful truth burst upon
him he staggered against the wall with a wailing cry of
agony, it was Janey who had died. Charles Taylor
leaned against the wall in his shock of agony; it was
one of those moments that can come only once in a life-time,
in many lives never, when the greatest of earthly
misery bursts upon the startled spirit, shattering it for
all time. Were Charles Taylor to live a hundred years
he could never know another moment like this, the
power so to feel would have left him. It had not left
him yet; it had scarcely come to him in its full realization;
at present he was half stunned. Strange as it
may seem, the first impression upon his mind was that
he was so much nearer the next world. How am I to
define this nearness? It was not that he was nearer to it
by time or in goodness; nothing of that.</p>

<small>CHARLES TAYLOR&#8217;S REGRETS.</small></h2></div>

<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/i_050.jpg" height="50" alt=""/>
</div>


<p class="drop-cap">JANEY had passed within its portals, and the great gulf
which divides time from eternity seemed to be but
a span. Now, to Charles Taylor, it was as if he in
spirit had followed her in from being a place far off.
Vague, indefinite, indistinct, it had suddenly been
brought to him close and palpable, or he to it. Had
Charles Taylor been an atheist, denying a hereafter&mdash;Heaven
in its compassion have mercy upon all such&mdash;that
one moment of suffering would have recalled him to
a sense of his mistake. It was as if he looked aloft with
the eyes of inspiration and saw the truth; it was as a
brief passing moment of revelation from God. She,
with her loving spirit, her gentle heart, her simple trust
in God, had been taken from this world to enter upon a
better. She was as surely living in it, had entered upon
its mysteries, its joys, its rest as that he was living here.
She, he believed, was as surely regarding him now, and
his great sorrow as that he was left alone to battle with
it. From this time Charles Taylor possessed a lively,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_47"></a>[47]</span>
ever-present link with that world, and knew that its
gates would, in God&#8217;s good time, be open for him. These
feelings, impressions, facts&mdash;you may designate them as
you please&mdash;took up their places in his mind, all in that
first instant, and seated themselves there forever; not
yet very consciously to his stunned senses. In his
weight of bitter grief nothing could be to him very
clear; ideas passed through his brain quickly, confusedly,
like unto the changing scenes in a phantasmagoria. He
looked round as one bewildered, the bed smoothed ready
for occupancy, on which on entering he had expected
to see the dead, but not her. There was between him
and the door Mary Ann Brewster, in her invalid chair
by the fire, a table at her right hand, covered with adjuncts
of the sick room, a medicine bottle with its accompanying
wine-glass and tablespoon, jelly and other
delicacies to tempt a faded appetite.</p>

<p>Mary Ann sat there and gazed at him with her hollow
eyes, from which the tears dropped slowly on her cadaverous
cheeks. Mrs. Brewster stood before him, sobs
choking her voice, wringing her hands. Yes, both were
weeping, but he&mdash; It is not in the presence of others that
man gives way to grief, neither will tears come to him in
the first leaden weight of anguish. Charles Taylor
listened mechanically, as one cannot do otherwise, to the
explanations of Mrs. Brewster. &#8220;Why did you not prepare
me? why did you let it come upon me with this
startling shock?&#8221; was his first remonstrance. &#8220;I did<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_48"></a>[48]</span>
prepare you,&#8221; sobbed Mrs. Brewster. &#8220;I telegraphed to
you as soon as it happened; I wrote the message to you
with my own hand, and sent it to the office before I
turned my attention to anything else.&#8221; &#8220;I received the
message, but you did not say&mdash;I thought it was&mdash;&#8221; Charles
Taylor turned his eyes toward Mary Ann. He remembered
her condition in the midst of his own anguish and
would not alarm her. &#8220;You did not mention Janey&#8217;s name,&#8221;
he continued, to Mrs. Brewster; &#8220;how could I suppose
you alluded to her or that she was sick?&#8221; Mary Ann
divined his motive of hesitation; she was uncommonly
keen in penetration, sharp&mdash;as the world goes&mdash;as the
world says, and she had noted his words on entering, when
he began to soothe Mrs. Brewster for the loss of a child.
She had noticed his startled recoil when the news fell on
him. She spoke up; a touch of her old vehemence; the
tears stopped on her face and her eyes glistened. &#8220;You
thought it was I who had died! Yes, you did, Mr. Taylor;
and you need not try to deny it; you would not have
cared, so that it was not Janey.&#8221; Charles had no intention
of contradicting her; he turned from her in silence
to look inquiringly and reproachfully at her mother.
&#8220;Mr. Taylor, I could not prepare you better than I did,&#8221;
said Mrs. Brewster, &#8220;when I wrote the letter telling of
her illness.&#8221; &#8220;What letter?&#8221; interrupted Charles; &#8220;I
received no letter.&#8221; &#8220;But you must have received it,&#8221;
replied Mrs. Brewster, in her quick and sharp manner,
not sharp with him, but from a rising doubt whether the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_49"></a>[49]</span>
letter had been miscarried. &#8220;I wrote it, and I know
that it was safely mailed; you should have received it
before you did the dispatch.&#8221; &#8220;I never had it,&#8221; said
Charles. &#8220;When I waited in your drawing-room now
I was listening for Janey&#8217;s footsteps to come to me.&#8221;
Charles Taylor upon inquiry found that the letter had
arrived duly and safely at Waterville at the time mentioned
by Mrs. Brewster, but it appears that it was overlooked
by the postmaster; but the shock had come now.
He took a seat by the table, and covered his eyes with
his hands, as the mother gave him a detailed account of
her sickness and death. Not all the account that she or
anybody else could give could take one iota from the
dreadful fact staring him in the face; she was gone, gone
forever from this world; he could never meet the glance
of her eyes again or hear her voice in response to his own.
Ah! reader, there are griefs that tell, rending the
heart as an earthquake would rend the earth, and all that
can be done is to sit down under them and ask of heaven
strength to bear&mdash;to bear as best we can, until time shall
shed a few drops of healing balm from its wings.</p>

<p>On the last night that Charles had seen her, Janey&#8217;s
eyes and brow were heavy, she had cried much during
the day and supposed the pain to have arisen from that
circumstance. She had given this explanation to Charles
Taylor. Neither he nor she had a thought that it could
come from any other source. More than a month ago
Mary Ann had taken the fever; fears of it for Janey had<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_50"></a>[50]</span>
passed away, and yet those dull eyes, that hot head, that
heavy weight of pain, were only the symptoms of the
sickness approaching. A night of tossing and turning,
in fits of disturbed sleep, of terrifying dreams, and Janey
awoke to the conviction that the fever was upon her.</p>

<p>About the time she generally arose she rang the bell
for Eliza. &#8220;I do not feel well,&#8221; she said, &#8220;as soon as
mamma is up will you ask her to come to me? do not
disturb her before.&#8221;</p>

<p>Eliza obeyed her orders. But her mother, tired and
worn out with her attendance upon Mary Ann, with
whom she had been up half the night, did not rise until
between nine and ten. The maid went to her then and
delivered the message.</p>

<p>&#8220;In bed, still; Miss Janey in bed, still?&#8221; exclaimed
Mrs. Brewster. She spoke in much anger, for Janey
had to be up in time, attending to Mary Ann, it was required
of her to be so. Throwing on a dressing-gown,
Mrs. Brewster proceeded to Janey&#8217;s room, and there she
broke into a storm of reproach and anger, never waiting
to ascertain what might be the matter with Janey, anything
or nothing.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ten o&#8217;clock, and that poor child to have been till
now with nobody to go near her but a servant!&#8221; she
reiterated, &#8220;you have no feeling, Janey!&#8221;</p>

<p>Janey drew the covering from her flushed face and
turned her glittering eyes, dull last night, shining with
the fever now upon her, upon her mother.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_51"></a>[51]</span>&#8220;Oh, mamma, I am sick; indeed I am. I can hardly
lift my head for the pain; feel how hot it is. I did not
think I ought to get up.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What is the matter with you?&#8221; sharply inquired
Mrs. Brewster.</p>

<p>&#8220;I cannot tell,&#8221; answered Janey, &#8220;I know that I feel
sick all over. I feel, mamma, as if I could not get up.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Very well; there&#8217;s that dear, suffering angel lying
alone, and you can think of yourself before her; if you
choose to lie in bed you must, but you will reproach
yourself for your selfishness when she is gone; another
twenty-four hours and she may not be with us; do as
you think best.&#8221;</p>

<p>Janey burst into tears and caught hold of her mother&#8217;s
robe as she was turning away. &#8220;Mamma, do not be
angry with me; I hope I am not selfish, mamma,&#8221; and
her voice sank to a whisper, &#8220;I have been thinking that
it may be the fever.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The fever?&#8221; reproachfully echoed Mrs. Brewster,
&#8220;Heaven help you for a selfish and fanciful child; did I
not send you to bed with a headache last night, and
what is it but the remains of that headache that you feel
this morning? I can see what it is, you have been
fretting about the departure of Charles Taylor; get up
out of that hot bed and dress yourself, and come in and
attend on your sister; you know she can&#8217;t bear to be
waited on by anybody but you; get up, I say.&#8221;</p>

<p>Will Mrs. Brewster remember this to her dying day?<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_52"></a>[52]</span>
I should were I in her place. She suppressed all mention
of it to Charles Taylor. &#8220;The dear child told me
that she did not feel well, but I only thought she had the
headache and that she would feel better up,&#8221; were the
words that she used to him.</p>

<p>What sort of a vulture was gnawing at her heart as
she spoke them? It was true that in her blind selfishness
for one undeserving child she had lost sight of the
fact that sickness could come to Janey; she had not
allowed herself to believe the probability; she, who accused
of selfishness that devoted, generous girl, who was
ready at all hours to put her hands under her sister&#8217;s
feet, and would have given her own life to save Mary
Ann&#8217;s. Janey got up, got up as best she could, her
limbs aching, her head burning; she went into her sister&#8217;s
room and did for her what she was able, gently,
lovingly, anxiously, as before. Ah, my dear reader,
let us be thankful that it was so; it is well to be stricken
down in the active path of duty, working until we
can work no more. She did so. She stayed where
she was until the day was half gone, bearing up
it is hard to say how. She could not eat breakfast;
she could not eat anything. None saw how sick she
was; her mother was wilfully blind. Mary Ann had
eyes and thoughts for herself alone. &#8220;What are you
shivering for?&#8221; her sister once fretfully asked her. &#8220;I
feel cold, dear,&#8221; was Janey&#8217;s unselfish answer; not a
word more did she say of her illness. In the afternoon<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_53"></a>[53]</span>
Mrs. Brewster was away from the room attending to
domestic affairs, and when she returned the doctor was
there; he had been prevented from calling earlier in the
day; they found Mary Ann dropped into a doze and
Janey stretched out on the floor before the fire, groaning;
but the groans ceased as she entered. The doctor,
regardless of the waking invalid, strode up to Janey and
turned her face to the light. &#8220;How long has she been
like this?&#8221; he asked, his voice shrill with emotion.
&#8220;Child, child, why did they not send for me?&#8221; Poor
Janey was then too sick to reply. The doctor carried
her up to her room in his arms, and the servants undressed
her and laid her in the bed from which she was
never more to rise. The fever took violent hold of her,
precisely as it had attacked Mary Ann, though scarcely
as bad, and danger for Janey was not looked for by her
mother. Had Mary Ann not got over a similar crisis they
would have feared for Janey, so given are we to judge by
collateral circumstances. It was on the fourth or fifth day
that highly dangerous symptoms supervened, and then her
mother wrote to Charles the letter which had not reached
him; there was this much of negative consolation to be
derived from the non-receipt, that had it been delivered
to him on the instant of its arrival he could not have been
in time to see her. &#8220;You ought to have written to me
as soon as she was taken sick,&#8221; he said to Mrs. Brewster.
&#8220;I would have done it had I apprehended danger,&#8221; she
repentantly answered, &#8220;but I never did, and the doctor<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_54"></a>[54]</span>
never did. I thought how pleasant it would be to get
her safely through the danger and sickness before you
knew of it.&#8221; &#8220;Did she not wish me written to?&#8221; The
question was asked firmly, abruptly, after the manner of
one who will not be cheated out of his answer. Her
mother could not evade it; how could she, with her child
lying dead over her head?</p>

<p>&#8220;It is true she did wish it, it was on the first day
of her illness that she spoke, &#8216;Write and tell Charles
Taylor,&#8217; she never said it but once.&#8221; &#8220;And you did not,&#8221;
he uttered, his voice hoarse with emotion. &#8220;Do not reproach
me! Do not reproach me!&#8221; cried Mrs. Brewster,
clasping her hands in supplication, and the tears
falling in showers from her eyes, &#8220;I did all for the best,
I never supposed there was danger. I thought what a
pity it would be to bring you back such a long journey,
putting you to so much unnecessary trouble and expense.&#8221;
Trouble and expense&mdash;in a case like that she
could speak of expense to Charles&mdash;but he thought how
she had to battle with both trouble and expense her
whole life long, and that for her they must wear a formidable
aspect, he remained silent. &#8220;I wish now I had
written,&#8221; she resumed in the midst of her choking sobs,
&#8220;as soon as the doctors said there was danger, I wished
it, but,&#8221; as if she would seek to excuse herself, &#8220;what
with the two upon my hands, she upstairs, Mary down
here, I had not a moment for proper reflection.&#8221; &#8220;Did
you tell her you had not written?&#8221; he asked, &#8220;or<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_55"></a>[55]</span>
did you let her lie day after day, hour after hour,
waiting and blaming me for my careless neglect?&#8221; &#8220;She
never blamed any one, you know she did not,&#8221; wailed
Mrs. Brewster, &#8220;and I think she was too sick to think
even of you, she was only sensible at times. Oh, I say,
do not reproach me, Mr. Taylor, I would give my own
life to bring her back. I never knew her worth until
she was gone, I never loved her as I love her now.&#8221;
There could be no doubt that Mrs. Brewster was reproaching
herself far more bitterly than any reproach
could tell upon her from Charles Taylor, an accusing
conscience is the worst of all evils. She sat there, her
head bent, swaying herself backwards and forwards on
her chair, moaning and crying. It was not a time
Charles felt to say a word of her past heartless conduct
in forcing Janey to breathe the infection of her sister&#8217;s
sick room, and all that he could say, all the reproaches,
all the remorse and repentance would not bring her back
to life. &#8220;Would you like to see her,&#8221; whispered her
mother, as he rose to go? &#8220;Yes.&#8221; She lighted a candle
and led the way upstairs. Janey had died in her
own room. At the door he took the candle from Mrs.
Brewster. &#8220;I must go in alone.&#8221; He passed into the
chamber and closed the door, on the bed laid out in a
white robe, lay all that remained of Janey Brewster.
Pale, still, pure, her face was wonderfully like what it
had been in life, and a calm smile rested upon it, but
Charles wished to be alone. Mrs. Brewster stood outside,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_56"></a>[56]</span>
leaning against the opposite wall, weeping silently,
the glimmer from the hall lamp below faintly lighting
the corridor, and she fancied that a sound of choking
struck upon her ears, and she pulled around her a small
black shawl that she wore, for grief had made her chilly,
and wept the faster. He came out by and by, calm and
quiet as ever, he did not see Mrs. Brewster standing
there in the dimly lighted hall, and went straight down,
carrying the candle. Mrs. Brewster caught up with
him at Mary Ann&#8217;s room, and took the candle from
him.</p>

<p>&#8220;She looks very peaceful, does she not?&#8221; was her
whisper. &#8220;She could not look otherwise.&#8221; He went
on down alone, intending to let himself out, but Eliza
had heard his steps and was waiting at the door. &#8220;Good
night Eliza,&#8221; he said, as he passed her. The girl did
not answer, she slipped out into the yard after him. &#8220;Oh,
sir, and didn&#8217;t you hear of it?&#8221; she whispered. &#8220;No.&#8221;
&#8220;If anybody was ever gone away to be an angel, sir, its
that sweet young lady, sir,&#8221; said Eliza, letting her tears
and sobs come forth as they would, &#8220;She was just one
here and she has gone to her own fit place.&#8221; &#8220;Yes,
that is so.&#8221; &#8220;You should have been in this house
throughout the whole of the illness to have seen the difference
between them, sir. Nobody would believe it;
Miss Brewster angry and snappish, and not caring who
suffered or who was sick, or who toiled, so that she was
served, Miss Janey lying like a tender lamb, patient and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_57"></a>[57]</span>
meek, thankful for all that was done for her. It does
seem hard, sir, that we should lose her forever.&#8221; &#8220;Not
forever, Eliza,&#8221; he answered. &#8220;And that is true, too; but
sir, the worst is, one can&#8217;t think of that sort of consolation
just when one&#8217;s troubles are the freshest. Good night,
to you, sir.&#8221; Charles Taylor walked on, leaving the
high road for a less frequented one; he went along,
musing in the depth of his great grief; there was no repining.
He was one to trace the finger of God in all
things. A more entire trust in God it was, perhaps, impossible
for any one to feel than was felt by Charles
Taylor; it was what he lived under. He could not see
why Janey should have been taken, why this great sorrow
should fall upon him, but that it must be for the best
he implicitly believed&mdash;the best, for God had done it.
How he was to live on without her he did not know.
How he could support the lively anguish of the future
he did not care to think. All his hopes in this life gone,
all his plans, his projects uprooted by a single blow,
never to return. He might look yet for the bliss of a
Hereafter that remains for the most heavy laden, thank
God, but his sun of happiness in this world had set forever.
The moon was not shining as it was the night he
left Janey, when he left his farewell kiss. Oh! that he
could have known that it was the last on the gentle lips
of Janey. There was no moon now; the stars were not
showing themselves, for a black cloud enveloped the
skies like a pall, fit accompaniment to his blasted hopes<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_58"></a>[58]</span>
and his path altogether was dark. But, as he neared
the office of the doctor, he could see him sitting in his
accustomed place. Charles thought that he would like
to have a few minutes conversation with him. He
walked to the door, opened it, and saw that the doctor
was alone.</p>

<small>DR. BROWN EXPLAINS TO CHARLES.</small></h2></div>

<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/i_063.jpg" height="50" alt=""/>
</div>


<p class="drop-cap">DOCTOR, why did you not write to me?&#8221; the doctor
brought down his fist on his desk with such force
as to cause some of his vials to fall over and waste their
contents; he had been bottling up his anger for some time
against Mrs. Brewster, and this was the first explosion.
&#8220;Because I understood that she had done so. I was
there when the poor child asked her to do it. I found
her on the floor in Mary Ann&#8217;s room; on the floor, if
you will believe it, lying there because she could not hold
her head up. Her mother had dragged her out of the
bed that morning, sick as she was, and forced her to attend
as usual upon Mary Ann. I got it all out of Eliza.
&#8216;Mamma,&#8217; she said, when I pronounced it to be the
fever, though she was almost beyond speaking then,
&#8216;you will write to Charles Taylor?&#8217; I never thought
but what she had done it; your sister inquired if you had
been written for and I told her yes.&#8221; &#8220;Doctor,&#8221; came
the next sad words, &#8220;could you not have saved her?&#8221;
The doctor shook his head and answered in a quiet<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_60"></a>[60]</span>
tone, looking down at the stopper of a vial which he had
caused to drop upon the floor, &#8220;neither care nor skill
could save her. I did the best that could be done, Taylor,&#8221;
raising his quick, dark eyes, flashing them with a
peculiar light; &#8220;she was ready to go; let it be your consolation.&#8221;
Charles Taylor made no answer, and there
was a pause of silence. The doctor continued: &#8220;As to
her mother, I hope that she may have her heart wrung
with remembrance for years to come. I don&#8217;t care what
people preach about charity and forgiveness, I do wish
it; but she will be brought to her senses, unless I am
mistaken. She has lost her treasure and kept her bane
a year or two more, and that is what Mary Ann will
be.&#8221; &#8220;She ought to have written to me.&#8221; &#8220;She ought
to do many things that she does not; she ought to have
sent Janey from the house, as I told her, as soon as the
disorder appeared in it. No, she kept her in her insane
selfishness, and now I hope she is satisfied with her
work. When alarming symptoms showed themselves
in Janey, on the fourth day of her illness, I think it
was, I said to her mother, it is strange what can be
keeping Mr. Taylor. &#8216;Oh,&#8217; said she, &#8216;I did not write for
him.&#8217; &#8216;Not write!&#8217; I answered; and I fear I used an
ugly word to her face. &#8216;I&#8217;ll write at once,&#8217; returned
she, humbly. &#8216;Of course,&#8217; said I, &#8216;after the horse is
stolen we always shut the barn door it&#8217;s the way of the
world.&#8217;&#8221; Another pause.</p>

<p>&#8220;I would have given anything to have taken Janey<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_61"></a>[61]</span>
from the house at the time; to take her away from the
town,&#8221; observed Charles in a low tone. &#8220;I said so then,
but it could not be.&#8221; &#8220;I should have done it in your
place,&#8221; said the doctor; &#8220;if her mother had said no, I
would have carried her away in front of her face.
&#8216;Not married,&#8217; you say. Rubbish to that; everybody
knows she would have been safe with you, and you
would have been married as soon as you could. What
are forms and ceremonies and long tongues in comparison
with a life like Janey&#8217;s?&#8221; Charles Taylor leaned his
head upon his hand, lost in the retrospect. Oh that he
had taken her, that he had set at naught what he had
then bowed to, the conventionalities of society, she might
have been by his side now in health and life to bless him.
Doubting words interrupted the train of thoughts.
&#8220;And yet I don&#8217;t know,&#8221; the doctor was repeating in a
dreamy manner, &#8220;what is to be will be; we look back,
all of us, and say, if I had acted thus, if I had done
the other thing, it would not have happened; events
would have turned out differently, but who is to be sure
of it. Had you carried Janey out of harm&#8217;s way, as we
might have thought, there is no telling but what she
might have had the fever just the same; her blood might
have become tainted before she left the house, there is
no knowing, Mr. Taylor.&#8221; &#8220;True. Good evening,
doctor.&#8221; He turned suddenly and hastily to go out of
the door, but the doctor caught him before he had
crossed the threshhold, and touched his arm to detain<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_62"></a>[62]</span>
him. They stood there in obscurity, their faces shaded
in the dusky night. &#8220;She left you a parting word, Mr.
Taylor, an hour before she died; she was calm and sensible,
though extremely weak. Mrs. Brewster had gone
to her favorite, and I was left alone with Janey. &#8216;Has
he not come yet?&#8217; she asked me, opening her eyes. &#8216;My
dear,&#8217; I said, &#8216;he could not come, he was never written
for,&#8217; for I knew she alluded to you, and was determined
to tell her the truth, dying though she was. &#8216;What shall
I say to him for you?&#8217; I continued. She raised her hand
to motion my face nearer hers, for her voice was growing
faint. &#8216;Tell him, with my dear love, not to grieve,&#8217;
she whispered between her panting breath, &#8216;tell him
that I am but gone on before.&#8217; I think they were almost
the last words that she spoke.&#8221; Charles Taylor leaned
against the post of the office entrance, and drank in the
words; then he shook the doctor&#8217;s hand and departed,
hurrying along like one who shrank from observation,
for he did not care just then to encounter the gaze of his
fellow-men. Coming with a quick step up the same
street on which the office is situated was the Reverend
Mr. Davis. He stopped to address the doctor. &#8220;Was
that Mr. Taylor?&#8221; &#8220;Yes; this is a blow for him.&#8221; Mr.
Davis&#8217; voice insensibly sank to a whisper. &#8220;My wife
tells me that he did not know of Janey&#8217;s death and sickness
until he arrived here. He thought it was Mary
Ann who died; he went to her mother&#8217;s thinking so.&#8221;
&#8220;Mrs. Brewster is a fool,&#8221; was the complimentary rejoinder<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_63"></a>[63]</span>
of the doctor. &#8220;She is in some things,&#8221; warmly
assented the pastor. &#8220;The telegram she sent was so
obscurely worded as to cause him to assume that it was
Mary Ann.&#8221; &#8220;Well, she is only heaping burdens on
her conscience,&#8221; rejoined the doctor in a philosophic
tone, &#8220;she has lost Janey through want of care, as I
firmly believe, in not keeping her out of the way of the
infection, she prevented their last meeting through not
writing to him, she&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He could not have saved her had he been here,&#8221; interrupted
Mr. Davis. &#8220;Nobody said he could; there
would have been satisfaction in it for him though, and
for her, too, poor child.&#8221; Mr. Davis did not contest the
point, he was so very practical a man that he saw little
use in last interviews; unless they were made productive
of actual good he was disposed to regard such as bordering
on the sentimental. &#8220;I have been over to see
Bangs,&#8221; he remarked. &#8220;They sent to the house after
me while I was after mail; the boy said he did not believe
he would live through the night and wanted the
parson. I had a great mind to send word back that if
he was in want of a parson he should have seen him before.&#8221;
&#8220;He&#8217;s as likely to live through this night as he
has been any night for the last six months,&#8221; said the
doctor. &#8220;Not a day since then but what he has been
as likely to die as not.&#8221; &#8220;And never to awaken to a
thought that it might be desirable to make ready for the
journey until the twelfth hour,&#8221; exclaimed the parson.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_64"></a>[64]</span>
&#8220;&#8216;When I have a convenient season I will call for thee.&#8217; If
I have been to see him once I have been twenty times,&#8221;
asserted the pastor, &#8220;and never could get him to pray.
He wilfully put off all thought of death until the twelfth
hour and then sends for me or one of my brethren and
expects one hour&#8217;s devotion will ensure his entrance into
heaven. I don&#8217;t keep the keys.&#8221; &#8220;Did Bangs send
for you or did the family?&#8221; inquired the doctor. &#8220;He, I
expect; he was dressed for the occasion.&#8221; &#8220;Will he live
long?&#8221; &#8220;It is uncertain; he may last for six months or
a year and he may die next week; it will be sudden
when it does come.&#8221; The pastor walked away at a brisk
rate. Mrs. Davis was out of the room talking with
some late applicant when he arrived at home. Laying
aside her wrap Mrs. Davis seated herself before the fire
in a quiet merino dress, the blaze flickering on her face
betrayed to the keen glance of the pastor that her eyelashes
were wet. &#8220;Grieving about Janey, I suppose?&#8221;
his tone a stern one. &#8220;Well,&#8221; continued the pastor,
&#8220;she is better off. The time may come, we none of us
know what is before us, when some of us who are left
may wish we had died, as she has; many a one battling
for very existence with the world&#8217;s carking cares wails
out a vain wish that he had been taken early from the
evil to come.&#8221; &#8220;It must be dreadful for Charles
Taylor,&#8221; she resumed, looking straight into the fire and
speaking as if in communion with herself more than her
husband. &#8220;Charley Taylor must find another love.&#8221;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_65"></a>[65]</span>
It was one of those phrases spoken in satire only, to
which the pastor of this village was occasionally given.
He saw so much to condemn in the world, things which
grated harshly on his superior mind, that his speech had
become imbued with a touch of gall, and he would often
give utterance to cynical remarks not at the time called
for. There came a day, not long afterwards, when the
residents of Bellville gathered at the church to hear and
see the last of Janey Brewster. As many came inside
as could, for it was known to the public that nothing displeased
their pastor so much as to have irreverent idlers
standing around the church staring and gaping and
whispering their comments while he was performing the
service of the burial of the dead, and his wishes were
generally respected.</p>

<p>The funeral now was inside the church. It had been
in so long that some eager watchers, estimating time by
their impatience, began to think it was never coming
out, but a sudden movement in the church reassured
them. Slowly, slowly, on it came, the Reverend Mr.
Davis leading the way, the coffin next, then came her
mother and a few other relatives, and Charles Taylor
with a stranger by his side; nothing more, save the pall-bearers
with white scarfs and the necessary attendants.
It was a perfectly simple funeral, corresponding well
with what the dead had been in her simple life. The
sight of this stranger took the curious gazers by surprise.
Who was he? A stout gentleman, past middle<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_66"></a>[66]</span>
age, holding his head high, with gold spectacles. He
proved to be a cousin of Mrs. Brewster. The grave
had been dug in a line with others not far from the edge
of the burying ground. On it came, crossing the broad
churchyard path which wound round to the road, crossing
over patches of grass, treading between mounds and
graves. The clergyman took his place at the head, the
mourners near him, the rest disposing themselves
quietly around. &#8220;Man, that is born of woman, hath
but a short time to live, and is full of misery. He cometh
up and is cut down like a flower; he fleeth as it were a
shadow, and never continueth in one place.&#8221; The crowd
held their breath and listened and looked at Charles
Taylor. He stood there, his head bowed, his face still,
the gentle wind stirring his thin dark hair. It was probably
a wonder to him in afterlife how he had contrived
in that closing hour to retain his calmness before the
world. &#8220;The coffin is lowered at last,&#8221; broke out a
little boy who had been more curious to watch the movements
of the men than the aspect of Charles Taylor.
&#8220;Hush, sir,&#8221; sharply rebuked his mother, and the minister&#8217;s
voice again stole over the silence. &#8220;For as much
as it has pleased Almighty God of His great mercy to
take unto himself the soul of our dear sister here departed,
we, therefore, commit her body to the ground,
earth to earth, ashes to ashes, dust to dust, in sure and
certain hope of the resurrection to eternal life, through
our Lord Jesus Christ, who shall change our vile bodies<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_67"></a>[67]</span>
that they may be like unto His glorious body, according
to the mighty working whereby He is able to subdue all
things to himself.&#8221; Every word came home to Charles
Taylor&#8217;s senses, every syllable vibrated upon his heart-strings;
that sure and certain hope laid hold of his soul
never again to leave it. It diffused its own holy peace
and calm in his troubled mind, and never until that moment
did he fully realize the worth, the truth of her
legacy. &#8220;Tell him that I am but gone on before,&#8221; a
few years. God, now present with him alone, knew
how few or how many, and Charles Taylor would have
joined her in eternal life. But why did the minister
come to a temporary pause? Because his eyes had
fallen upon one then coming up from the entrance
of the burying ground to take his place among the
mourners, and who had evidently arrived in a hurry.
He wore neither scarf nor hat-band, nothing but a full
suit of plain black clothes. &#8220;Look, mamma,&#8221; cried a
little boy. It was George Taylor, the cousin of Charles
Taylor. He stood quietly by the side of his cousin, his
hat in his hand, his head bowed, his curly hair waiving
in the breeze. It was all the work of an instant, and
the minister continued: &#8220;I heard a voice from heaven
saying unto me, write, from henceforth blessed are the
dead which die in the Lord, even so, sayeth the spirit,
for they rest from their labors,&#8221; and so went on the service
to the end. The passage having been cleared, several
mourning carriages were in waiting. Charles Taylor<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_68"></a>[68]</span>
come forth leaning on his cousin&#8217;s arm, both of them
still bare headed. They entered one, the friends and
relatives filled the others, and soon several men were
shovelling earth upon the coffin as fast as they could,
sending it with a rattle on the bright plate which told
who was moldering within, Janey Brewster, aged twenty-one
years. &#8220;Charles,&#8221; cried his cousin George, leaning
forward and seizing his cousin&#8217;s hand impulsively, as
the carriage moved slowly on, &#8220;I should have been
here in good time, but for a delay in the train.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Where did you hear of it? I did not know where
to write to you,&#8221; calmly asked Charles. &#8220;I heard of it
in Gray Town and I came up here at once; Charles,
could they not save her?&#8221; A slight negative movement
was all Charles Taylor&#8217;s answer.</p>

<p>The time went on, several months had passed, positions
changed and Bellville was itself again; the unusually
lovely weather which had prevailed so far as it
had gone had put it into Mrs. Brown&#8217;s head to give an
out-door entertainment, the doctor had suggested that
the weather might change, that there was no dependence
to be placed in it, but she would not change her
plans if the worst came to the worst, at the last moment
she said they must do the best they could with them inside.
But the weather was not fickle, the day rose
warm, calm and wonderfully bright, and by five in the
afternoon, most of the gay revellers had gathered on the
grounds. George Taylor, a cousin of Charles arrived,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_69"></a>[69]</span>
one of the first; he was making himself conspicuous
among the many groups, or perhaps, it was they
that made him so by gathering around him, when
two figures in mourning came up behind him, one of
whom spoke &#8220;How do you do, Mr. George Taylor,&#8221;
he turned, and careless and thoughtless and graceless,
as he was reported to be, a shock of surprise not unmixed
with indignation swept over his feelings, for there
standing before him were Mrs. Brewster and Mary Ann.
She&mdash;Mary Ann&mdash;looked like a shadow, still peevish,
white, discontented; what brought them there, was it so
they showed their regrets for the dead Janey, was it
likely that Mary Ann should appear at a feast of gayety
in her weak state, sickly, not yet recovered from the
effects of the fever, not yet out of the first deep mourning
for Janey. &#8220;How do you do, Mrs. Brewster,&#8221; very
gravely responded George. Mrs. Brewster may have
discerned somewhat his feelings from the expression
on his face, not that he intentionally suffered it to rise in
reproof of her. George Taylor did not set himself up
in judgment against his fellow-men. Mrs. Brewster
drew him aside with her after he had shaken hands with
Mary Ann. &#8220;I am sure it must look strange to you to
see us both here, Mr. Taylor, but poor child, she continues
so weak and poorly that I scarcely know what to
do with her, she set her heart upon coming here ever
since Mrs. Brown&#8217;s invitation arrived; she has talked of
nothing else, and I thought it would not do to cross her.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_70"></a>[70]</span>&#8221;
&#8220;Is Mr. Taylor here?&#8221; &#8220;Oh no,&#8221; replied George, with
more haste than he need have spoken. &#8220;I thought he
would not be, I remarked so to Mary Ann when she
expressed a hope for seeing him, indeed I think it was
that hope which chiefly urged her to come; what have
we done to him, Mr. George, he scarcely ever comes
near the house?&#8221; &#8220;I don&#8217;t know anything about it,&#8221;
returned George; &#8220;I can see that my cousin feels his
loss deeply, yet it may be that visits to your house remind
him of Janey too forcibly.&#8221; &#8220;Will he ever marry,
do you think?&#8221; said Mrs. Brewster, lowering her voice
to a confidential whisper.</p>

<p>&#8220;At present I should be inclined to say he never
would,&#8221; answered George, wondering what in the world
it would matter to her and thinking she evinced little
sorrow or consideration for the memory of Janey. &#8220;But
time works surprising changes,&#8221; he added. &#8220;And time
may affect Mr. Taylor,&#8221; Mrs. Brewster paused, &#8220;How
do you think she looks, my poor child?&#8221; &#8220;Miserable&#8221;
almost rose to the tip of George&#8217;s tongue, &#8220;she does
not look well,&#8221; he said aloud. &#8220;And she does so regret
her dear sister, she&#8217;s grieving after her always,&#8221; said Mrs.
Brewster, putting her handkerchief to her eyes. I don&#8217;t
believe it, thought George to himself. &#8220;How did you
like Graytown?&#8221; she resumed, passing with little ceremony
to another topic. &#8220;I liked it very well; all places
are pretty much alike to a bachelor, Mrs. Brewster.&#8221;
&#8220;Yes, so they are, you won&#8217;t remain a bachelor very<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_71"></a>[71]</span>
long,&#8221; continued Mrs. Brewster with a smile of jocularity.
&#8220;Not so very long I dare say,&#8221; acknowledged
George. &#8220;It is possible I may put my head in the
noose some time in the next ten years.&#8221; She would have
detained him further, but George did not care to be detained,
he went after more attractive companionship.
Chance or accident led him to Miss Flint, a niece of
Mrs. Brown. Miss Flint had all her attractions about her
that day, her bright pink silk&mdash;for pink was a favorite
color of hers&mdash;was often seen by the side of George
Taylor, once they strayed to the borders of a river in a
remote part of the village, several were gathered there,
a row on the water had been proposed and a boat stood
ready, a small boat, capable of holding very few persons,
but of these George and Julia Flint made two; could
George have foreseen what that simple little excursion
was going to do for him, he would not have taken part
in it; how is it no sign of warning comes over us at
these times; how many a day&#8217;s pleasure began as a
jubilee, how many a voyage entered upon in hope ends
but in death. Oh, if we could but lift the veil what
mistakes might be avoided! George Taylor, strong and
active, took the oars, and when they had rowed about
to their hearts&#8217; content and George was nearly overdone
from exertion, they thought that they would land for
awhile on what is called Dark Point, a mossy spot green
and tempting to the eye. In stepping ashore Miss Flint
tripped and lost her balance, and would have been in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_72"></a>[72]</span>
the water, but for George who saved her, but could
not save her parasol, an elegant one, for which Miss Flint
had paid a round sum of money just the day before; she
naturally shrieked, when it went plunge into the water,
and George, in recovering it, nearly lost his balance, and
went in after the parasol, nearly not quite; he got himself
pretty wet, but he made light of it, and sat on the grass
with the others. The party were all young, old people
don&#8217;t venture much in skiffs, but had any been there of
mature age, they would have ordered him home to get
a change of clothes, and a glass of brandy. By and by he
began to feel chilly, it might have occurred to him that
the intense perspiration he had been in had struck inwards,
but it did not. In the evening he was dancing
with the rest of them thinking no more of it, apparently
having escaped all ill effects from the wetting.</p>

<small>JOHN SMITH&#8217;S DINNER PARTY.</small></h2></div>

<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/i_077.jpg" height="50" alt=""/>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">THE drawing-rooms of John Smith&#8217;s mansion were
teeming with light, with noise, and with company;
a dinner party had taken place that day, a gentleman&#8217;s
party. It was not often that he gave one, and when he
did it was thoroughly well done. George Taylor did not
give better dinners than Mr. Smith. The only promised
guest who had failed in his attendance was Charles
Taylor. Very rarely indeed did he accept of invitations
to dinner. If there was one man in all the county
to whom Mr. Smith seemed inclined to pay court, to
treat with marked consideration and respect, that man
was Charles Taylor; he nearly always declined&mdash;declined
courteously, in a manner which could not afford the
slightest evidence of offense; he was of quiet habits,
not strong in health of late, and, though he had to give
dinner parties himself and attend some of his cousins&#8217; for
courtesy&#8217;s sake, his friends nearly all were kind enough
to excuse him frequenting theirs in return. This
time Charles Taylor had yielded to Mr. Smith&#8217;s pressing<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_74"></a>[74]</span>
entreaties made in person and promised to be present, a
promise which was not, as it proved to be, kept. All
the rest of the guests had assembled and they were only
waiting the appearance of Mr. Taylor to sit down when
a hasty note arrived from Miss Taylor. &#8220;Mr. Taylor
was taken sick while dressing, and was unable to attend.&#8221;
So they sat down without him. The dinner having been
over most of the guests had gone to the drawing-room,
which was radiant with light and noisy with the
hum of many voices. A few had gone home, a few had
taken cigars and were strolling outside the dining-room
windows in the bright moonlight. Miss Taylor&#8217;s note
that her brother had been taken sick while dressing for
the dinner was correct; he was dressing in his room when
he was attacked by a sharp internal pain, he hastily sat
down, a cry escaping his lips and drops of water gathering
on his brow; alone he bore it, calling for no aid; in a
few minutes the paroxysm had partially passed and he
rang for his servant, who had for many years attended
his father. &#8220;George, I am sick again,&#8221; said Charles,
quietly. &#8220;Will you ask Miss Taylor to write a line
to Mr. Smith, saying that I am unable to attend.&#8221;
George cast a strangely yearning look on the pale
suffering face of his master, he had been in these
paroxysms of pain once or twice. &#8220;I wish you would
have Mr. Brown called in, sir,&#8221; he cried. &#8220;I think I
shall, he may give me some ease, possibly; take my message
to your mistress, George.&#8221; The effect of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_75"></a>[75]</span>
message was to bring Mary to his room, &#8220;taken sick, a
sharp inward pain,&#8221; she was repeating after George.
&#8220;Charles, what kind of a pain is it, it seems to me that
you have had the same before?&#8221; &#8220;Write a few words
the first thing, will you, Mary; I do not like to keep them
waiting for me.&#8221; Mary was as punctilious as Charles,
and as considerate as he was for the convenience of
others, and she sat down and wrote the note, dispatching
it at once by Billy, another of the servants; few
could have sat apart and done it as calmly as Mary, considering
that she had a great thumping at her heart, a
fear which had never penetrated it until this moment.
Their mother&#8217;s sickness was similar to this, a sharp
acute pain had occasionally attacked her, the symptom
of the inward malady of which she had died. Was
the same fatal malady attacking him? The doctors had
expressed their fears then that it might be hereditary.
In the hall, as Mary was going back to Charles&#8217; room,
the note having been written, she met George, the sad
apprehensive look in the old man&#8217;s face struck her, she
touched his arm and motioned him into another room.
&#8220;What is it that is the matter with your master?&#8221; &#8220;I
don&#8217;t know,&#8221; was the answer; but the words were spoken
in a tone which caused Mary to think that the old man was
awake to the same fears that she was. &#8220;Miss Mary, I am
afraid to think what it may be.&#8221; &#8220;Is he often sick like
this?&#8221; &#8220;I know but of a time or two ma&#8217;am, but that&#8217;s
a time or two too many.&#8221; Mary entered his room,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_76"></a>[76]</span>
Charles was leaning back in his chair, his face ghastly,
apparently prostrate from the effects of the pain; if a momentary
thought had crossed her mind, that he might have
written the note himself, it left her; now things were coming
into her mind one by one, how much time he had
spent in his room of late; how seldom, comparatively
speaking, he went to his office; how often he called for the
carriage, when he did go, instead of walking; only this
last Sunday he had not gone near the church all day long,
her fears grew into certainties. She took a chair, drawing
it near to Charles, not speaking of her fears, but asking
him in an agreeable tone how he felt, and what had
caused his illness. &#8220;Have you had this pain before?&#8221;
she continued, &#8220;Several times,&#8221; he answered, &#8220;but it has
been worse to-night than I have previously felt it. Mary I
fear it may be the warning of my call, I did not think that
I would leave you so soon.&#8221; Except that Mary&#8217;s face
turned nearly as pale as his and that her fingers entwined
themselves together so tightly as to cause pain,
there was no outward sign of the grief that laid hold of
her heart. &#8220;Charles, what is the complaint you are fearing?&#8221;
she asked after a pause, &#8220;The same that my
mother had,&#8221; he quietly answered, speaking the words
that Mary would not speak. &#8220;It may not be so,&#8221;
gasped Mary. &#8220;True, but I think it is.&#8221; &#8220;Why have
you never spoken of this?&#8221; &#8220;Because, until to-night, I
have doubted whether it was so or not; the suspicion
that it might be so, certainly was upon me, but it<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_77"></a>[77]</span>
amounted to no more than a suspicion; at times when I
feel quite well I argue that I must be wrong.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Have you consulted a doctor?&#8221; &#8220;I am going to do
so now. I have just sent George after one.&#8221; &#8220;It should
have been done before, Charles.&#8221; &#8220;Why, if it is as I
suspect, Brown and all his brethren cannot save me.&#8221;
Mary clasped her hands upon her knee and sat with her
head bowed. It seemed that the only one left on earth with
whom she could sympathize was Charles, and now perhaps
he was going. The others had their own pursuits
and interests, but she and Charles seemed to stand together;
with deep sorrow for him, the brother whom she
dearly loved, came other considerations, impossible not
to occur to a practical, foreseeing mind like Mary&#8217;s. His
elbow on the arm of his chair, and his head resting
upon his hand, sat Charles, his mind in as deep a reverie
as his sister&#8217;s. Where was it straying? To the remembrance
of Janey, to the day that he had stood over her
grave when they were placing her in it, was the time
come, or nearly come, to which he had from that time
looked forward&mdash;the time of his joining her. Perhaps the
fiat of death could have come to few who could meet it
as serenely as Charles Taylor. It would hardly be right
to say welcome it, but certain it was that the prospect was
one of pleasure rather than pain to him; to one who had
lived near to God on earth the anticipation can bring no
great dismay. It brought none to Charles Taylor, but
he was not done with earth and its cares yet. Matilda<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_78"></a>[78]</span>
Taylor was away from home that week, she had gone
to spend it with some friends at a distance. Martha was
alone when Mary returned to the drawing-room, she had
no suspicion of the sorrow that was overhanging the
house. She had not seen Charles go to his office,
and felt surprised at his tardiness. &#8220;How late he will
be, Mary.&#8221; &#8220;Who?&#8221; &#8220;Charles.&#8221; &#8220;He is not going,
he is not very well to-day,&#8221; was the reply. Martha
thought nothing of it, how should she. Mary buried
her fears within her, and said no more. Martha Taylor
has had a romance in her life as so many have had. It
had partially died out years ago, not quite; its sequel had
to come. She sat there listlessly, her pretty hands resting
on her knees, her beautiful face tinged with the sunlight&mdash;sat
there thinking of him&mdash;Mark Blakely. A romance
it had really been. Martha had paid a long visit
to Mrs. Blakely some four or five years before this time.
She, Mrs. Blakely, was in perfect health then, fond of
gayety, and had many visitors, and before he and Martha
knew well what they were about, they had learned to love.
He was the first to awake from the pleasant dream, to
know what it meant, and he directly withdrew himself
out of harm&#8217;s way. Harm only to himself, as he supposed.
He never suspected that the like love had won
its way to Martha&#8217;s heart. A strictly honorable man,
he would have killed himself in self-condemnation had
he suspected that it had. Not until he had gone did
Martha find out that he was a married man. When only<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_79"></a>[79]</span>
nineteen years of age he had been drawn into one of
those unequal and unhappy alliances that can only bring
a flush to the face in after years. Many a hundred
times had it dyed that of Mark Blakely. Before he was
twenty he had separated from his wife, when Miss
Martha was still a child, and the next six years he traveled
on the continent, striving to lose its remembrance.
His own family, you may be sure, did not pain him by
alluding to it then or after his return. He had no residence
in the neighborhood of Bellville. When he visited
the town he was the guest of the postmaster, Mr. Hunt.
So it happened when Martha met him at his home she
never thought of his being a married man. On Mrs.
Blakely&#8217;s part, she never thought that Martha did
not know it. Mark supposed she knew it, and
when the thought would flash over him, he would say
mentally, &#8220;how she must despise me for my mad
folly.&#8221; He had learned to love her, to love her
passionately, never so much as harboring the thought
that it could not be reciprocated&mdash;he a married
man. But this was no less folly than the other had
been, and Mark Blakely had the good sense to leave
the place. A day or two after he left his mother received
a letter from him. Martha was in her dressing-room
when she read it. &#8220;How strange,&#8221; was the comment
of Mrs. Blakely. &#8220;What do you think, Martha?&#8221;
she added, lowering her voice. &#8220;When he reached Paris
there was a note sent to him saying that his wife was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_80"></a>[80]</span>
dying, and imploring him to come and see her.&#8221; &#8220;His
wife,&#8221; cried Martha; &#8220;whose wife?&#8221; &#8220;My son&#8217;s; have
you forgotten that he had a wife? I wish that we all
could really forget it; it has been the blight upon his
life.&#8221; Martha had discretion enough left in that unhappy
moment not to betray that she had been ignorant
of the fact. When her burning cheeks had cooled a little,
she turned from the window where she had been
hiding them and escaped to her own room. The revelation
had betrayed to her the secret of her own feelings
for Mark Blakely, and in her pride and rectitude she
thought that she would die. A day or two more and he
was a widower. He suffered some months to elapse and
then came to Bellville, his object being to visit Martha
Taylor. She believed that he meant to ask her to be
his wife, and Martha was not wrong. She could give
herself up now to the full joy of loving him. Busy
tongues, belonging to some young ladies who could
boast more wit than discretion, hinted something of this
to Martha. She, being vexed at having her private feelings
suspected, spoke slightingly of Mark Blakely.
&#8220;Did they think that she would stoop to a widower, one
who had made himself so notorious by his first marriage?&#8221;
she asked, and this, word for word, was repeated to Mark
Blakely; it was repeated to him by those false friends,
and Martha&#8217;s haughty manner as she spoke it offensively
commented upon. Mark Blakely, believing it fully,
judged that he had no chance with Martha, and, without<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_81"></a>[81]</span>
speaking to her of his intentions, he again left. But
now no suspicion of this conversation having been repeated
to him ever reached Martha. She considered
his behavior very bad. Whatever restraint he had laid
upon his manner towards her when at his home, he had
been open enough since, and she could only believe his
conduct unjustifiable, the result of fickleness. All this
time, between two and three years, had she been trying
to forget it. If she had received an offer of marriage
from a young and handsome man; it would have been
in every way desirable; but poor Martha found that
Mark Blakely was too deeply seated in her heart for her
to admit thought of another. And again Mark Blakely
had returned to Bellville, and, as Martha had heard,
dined at Mrs. Hunt&#8217;s, the wife of the postmaster; he had
called at her house since his return, but she was out.</p>

<p>She sat there thinking of him, her prominent feeling
against him being anger. She believed until this hour
that he had treated her mean; that his behavior had been
unbecoming a gentleman. Her reflections were disturbed
by the entrance of Doctor Brown. It was growing
dark then, and she wondered what brought him
there so late&mdash;in fact, what brought him there at all.
She turned and asked the question of Mary. &#8220;He has
come to see Charles,&#8221; replied Mary; and Martha noticed
that her sister was sitting in a strangely still attitude, her
head bowed down; but she did not connect it with the
real cause. It was nothing unusual to see Mary lost in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_82"></a>[82]</span>
deep thought. &#8220;What is the matter with Charles, that
Mr. Brown should come?&#8221; inquired Martha. &#8220;He did
not feel well and sent for him.&#8221; It was all that Mary
answered, and Martha continued in blissful ignorance of
anything being wrong and resumed her reflections on
Mark Blakely. Mary saw the doctor before he went
away; afterward she went to Charles&#8217; room, and remained
in it. Martha remained in the dining-room,
buried in her dream of love. The rooms were lighted,
but the blinds were not closed.</p>

<p>Martha was near the window, looking forth into the
bright moonlight. It must have been getting quite
late, when she discovered some one approaching their
house. She thought at first that it might be her
cousin George, but, as the figure drew nearer, her
heart gave a great bound, and she saw that it was he
upon whom her thoughts had been fixed. Yes, it was
Mark Blakely. When he mentioned to Mrs. Hunt that
he had a visit to pay to a sick friend, he had reference
to Charles Taylor. Mark Blakely, since his return, had
been struck with the change in Charles Taylor; it was
more perceptible to him than to those who saw Charles
habitually, and, when the apology came for Mr. Taylor&#8217;s
absence, Mark determined to call upon him at once,
though, in talking with Mrs. Hunt, he nearly let the
time for it slip by. Martha arose when he entered; in
broad day he might have seen, beyond a doubt, her
changing face, telling of emotion. Was he mistaken in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_83"></a>[83]</span>
fancying that she was agitated? His pulses quickened
at the thought, for Martha was as dear to him as she
had ever been. &#8220;Will you pardon my intrusion at this
hour?&#8221; he asked, taking her hand and bending towards
her with his sweet smile. &#8220;It is later than I thought it
was&mdash;indeed, the hall clock was striking ten! I was
surprised to hear of your brother&#8217;s illness, and wished to
hear how he was before I left for home.&#8221; &#8220;He has
kept his room this evening,&#8221; replied Martha. &#8220;My sister
is sitting with him; I do not think it is anything serious,
but he has not appeared very well of late.&#8221; &#8220;Indeed, I
trust it is nothing serious,&#8221; warmly responded Mark
Blakely. Martha fell into silence; she supposed that
the servant had told Mary that he was there and that
she would be in. Mark went to the window. &#8220;The
same charming scene,&#8221; he exclaimed; &#8220;I think the
moonlight view from this window is beautiful, the
dark trees around, and these white stone mansions,
rising there, remain on my memory like the scene of
an old painting.&#8221; He folded his arms and stood
there gazing still. Martha stole a look up at him
at his pale, attractive face, with its expression of care.
She had wondered once why that look of care was conspicuous
there; but not after she became acquainted
with his domestic history.</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you going away to remain Mr. Blakely,&#8221; the
question awoke him from his reverie, he turned to
Martha and a sudden impulse prompted him to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_84"></a>[84]</span>
address her on the subject nearest his heart. &#8220;I
would remain if I could induce one to share my
name and home. Forgive me, Martha, if I anger
you by speaking so hastily; will you forget the past and
help me to forget it; will you let me make you my dear
wife?&#8221; In saying will you forget the past, Mark
Blakely alluded to his first marriage in his extreme
sensitiveness on that point, he doubted whether Martha
would object to succeed the dead Mrs. Blakely, he believed
those hasty and ill-natured words reported to him
as having been spoken by her, bore on that point alone.
Martha on the contrary assumed that her forgetfulness
was asked for his own behavior to her in so far that he
had gone away and left her without a word of explanation.
She grew quite pale with anger. Mark Blakely
resumed; his manner earnest, his voice low and tender,
&#8220;I have loved you Martha from the first day that I saw
you at my mother&#8217;s, I dragged myself away from the
place because I loved you, fearing that you might come
to see my folly, it was worse than folly then, for I was
not a free man. I have continued loving you more and
more from that time to this. I went abroad this last
time hoping to forget you; but I cannot do it, and my
love has only become stronger. Forgive, I say, my
urging it upon you in this moment of impulse.&#8221; Poor
Martha was greatly excited, went abroad hoping to forget
her, striving to forget her, it was worse and worse. She
pushed his hand away. &#8220;Oh! Martha, can you not love<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_85"></a>[85]</span>
me?&#8221; he exclaimed in agitation. &#8220;Will you not give me
hopes that you will some time be my wife.&#8221; &#8220;No, I
cannot love you; I will not give you hopes. I would
rather marry any man in the world than you; you ought
to be ashamed of yourself, Mr. Blakely!&#8221; Not a very
dignified rejoinder, and Martha first with anger and then
with love, burst into even less dignified tears, and left the
room in a passion. Mark Blakely bit his lips in disgust.
Mary entered unsuspicious; he turned from the window
and smoothed his brow, gathering what equanimity he
could as he proceeded to inquire after Mr. Taylor.
About a month after this interview Martha Taylor
walked out from the dining-room to enjoy the
beauty of the spring evening, or to indulge her own
thoughts as might be. She strayed to the edge of the
grounds and there sat down on the garden bench, not
to remain alone long. She was interrupted by the very
man upon whom, if the disclosure must be made, her
evening thoughts had centered. He was coming up with
a quick step, seeing Martha he stopped to accost her,
his heart beating, beating from the quick steps or from
the sight of Martha, he best knew. Many a man&#8217;s
heart has beaten at the sight of a less lovely vision. She
wore white, set off with blue ribbons, and her golden
hair glittered in the sunlight. She nearly screamed
with surprise; she had been thinking of him, it was
true, but as one who was miles away. In spite of his
stormy and not long past rejection, he went straight to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_86"></a>[86]</span>
her and held out his hand. Did he notice that her blue
eyes dropped beneath his as she rose to answer his
greeting? that the soft color on her cheeks changed to
a hot damask. &#8220;I fear I have surprised you,&#8221; said
Mark. &#8220;A little,&#8221; acknowledged Martha. &#8220;I did not
know you were in Bellville. Charles will be glad to see
you.&#8221;</p>

<p>She turned to walk with him to the house and
as in courtesy bound, Mark Blakely offered her his
arm, and Martha condescended to accept it; neither
broke the silence, and they reached the large porch at
the Taylor mansion. Martha spoke then. &#8220;Are you
going to make a long stay in England?&#8221; &#8220;A very short
one; a party of friends are leaving for New York, and they
wish me to accompany them, I think I shall go.&#8221; &#8220;To
New York that is a long distance.&#8221; Mark smiled, &#8220;I am
an old traveler, you know.&#8221; Martha opened the dining-room
door, Charles was alone, he had left the table and
was seated in his armchair by the window, a glad smile
illumed his face when he saw Mark, he was one of the
very few of whom Charles had made a close friend,
these close friends, not more than one or two perhaps,
can we meet in a life-time; acquaintances many, but
friends, those to whom the heart can speak out its inmost
thoughts who may be as our own souls, how few.
&#8220;Have you been to tea?&#8221; asked Charles. &#8220;I have dined
at the hotel,&#8221; replied Mark. &#8220;Have you come to make
a long stay?&#8221; inquired Charles. &#8220;I shall leave to-morrow,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_87"></a>[87]</span>
having nothing to do I thought that I would come
and see you, I am pleased to see you looking better.&#8221;
&#8220;The warm weather seems to be doing me a little
good,&#8221; was Charles Taylor&#8217;s reply; a consciousness
within him of how little better he really was, Charles proceeded
with Mark to the drawing-room where his sisters
were, and a pleasant hour or two they all spent together.</p>

<small>GEORGE TAYLOR GIVES A PARTY.</small></h2></div>

<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/i_092.jpg" height="50" alt=""/>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">MATILDA laughed at him a great deal about his proposed
expedition to New York, telling him she
did not believe that he was serious in saying he entertained
it. It was a beautiful night, soft, warm and lovely,
the clock was striking ten when Mark arose to depart.
&#8220;If you will wait a few minutes I will go a little way with
you,&#8221; said Charles Taylor, he withdrew to another room
for his coat, then he rejoined him, passed his arm in Mark
Blakely&#8217;s and went out with him. &#8220;Is this New York
project a joke?&#8221; asked Charles. &#8220;Indeed, no, I have
not quite made up my mind to go, I think I shall; if so,
I shall go in a week from this, why should I not go, I
have no settled home, no ties?&#8221; &#8220;Should you not,
Mark, be the happier if you had a settled home; you
might form ties, I think a roving life must be a very
undesirable one.&#8221; &#8220;It is one I was never fitted for, my
inclination would lead me to love home and domestic happiness,
but as you know, I put that out of my power.&#8221;
&#8220;For a time, but that is over, you might marry again.&#8221;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_89"></a>[89]</span>
&#8220;I do not think I ever shall,&#8221; returned Mark Blakely,
feeling half prompted to tell his unsuspicious friend that
his own sister was the barrier.</p>

<p>&#8220;You have never married,&#8221; he resumed, allowing the
impulse to die away. Charles Taylor shook his head;
&#8220;the cases are different,&#8221; he said: &#8220;In your wife you
lost one whom you could not regret.&#8221; &#8220;Don&#8217;t call her
by that name Charles;&#8221; burst forth Mark Blakely. &#8220;And
in Janey I lost one who was all the world to me who
could never be replaced,&#8221; Charles resumed, after a
pause; &#8220;the cases were widely different.&#8221; &#8220;Yes, widely
different,&#8221; assented Mark Blakely, they walked on in
silence, each buried in his own thoughts, at the commencement
of the road, Mark Blakely stopped, and took
Charles Taylor&#8217;s hand in his, &#8220;you shall not come any
farther with me.&#8221;</p>

<p>Charles stopped also, he had not intended to go
farther. &#8220;You shall really go to New York then.&#8221; &#8220;I
believe I shall.&#8221; &#8220;Take my blessing with you, then
Blakely we may never meet again in this world.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What!&#8221; exclaimed Mark. &#8220;The medical men entertain
hopes that my life may not be terminated so speedily,
I believe that a few months will end it, I may not live
to welcome you home.&#8221; It was the first intimation
Mark Blakely had received of Charles fatal malady,
Charles explained to him; he was overwhelmed. &#8220;Oh
my friend! my friend! can not death be coaxed to spare
you!&#8221; he called out in excitement, how many have vainly<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_90"></a>[90]</span>
echoed the same cry! A few more words, a long grasp
of the lingering hands, and they parted, Charles with a
God speed, Mark with a different prayer, a God save
upon his lips. Mark Blakely turned to the road, Charles
towards home. George Taylor&#8217;s dinner-table was
spacious, but the absence of one person from it was
conspicuous. Mr. Blakely&#8217;s chair was still left. &#8220;He
would come yet.&#8221; George said there was no clergyman
present, and Charles Taylor said the grace, he sat
at the foot of the table opposite his cousin.</p>

<p>&#8220;We are thirteen!&#8221; exclaimed Mr. Feathersmith, a
young man of this aristocratic gathering, &#8220;it is the ominous
number, you know.&#8221; Some of them laughed.
&#8220;What is that peculiar superstition?&#8221; asked Major
&#8220;What is that peculiar superstition?&#8221; asked Major
Black, &#8220;I have never been able to understand it.&#8221;
&#8220;The superstition is that if a party of thirteen sit down
to dinner one of them is sure to die before the year is
up,&#8221; replied the young man, speaking with grave seriousness.
&#8220;Why is not thirteen as good a number to sit
down as any other number?&#8221; cried Major Black. &#8220;As
good as fourteen, for instance?&#8221; &#8220;It&#8217;s the odd number.&#8221;
&#8220;The odd number; it&#8217;s no more the odd number than any
other number is odd that&#8217;s not even. What do you say to
eleven? What do you say to fifteen?&#8221; &#8220;I can&#8217;t explain
it,&#8221; returned the young man, with an air of indifference.
&#8220;I only know that the superstition does
exist, and that I have noticed in more instances than
one that it has been carried out. Three or four parties of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_91"></a>[91]</span>
thirteen who have sat down to dinner have lost one of their
number before the close of the year. You laugh at me,
of course. I have been laughed at before; but suppose
you notice it now; there are thirteen of us, see if we all
are alive at the end of the year.&#8221; Charles Taylor in
his heart thought it not unlikely that one of them, at
any rate, would not be living. Several faces were smiling
with amusement, the most serious of them was Mark
Blakely. &#8220;You don&#8217;t believe in it, Blakely?&#8221; cried one,
in surprise, as he gazed at him. &#8220;I certainly do not, why
should you ask it?&#8221; &#8220;You look so grave over it.&#8221;
&#8220;I never like to joke, though it be but a smile, on
the subject of death,&#8221; replied Mark. &#8220;I once received
a lesson on the point, and it will serve me for life.&#8221;
&#8220;Will you tell us what it was?&#8221; interposed Mr.
Feathersmith, who was introduced to Mr. Blakely that
day. &#8220;I cannot tell it now,&#8221; replied Mark. &#8220;It is not a
subject suited to a merry party,&#8221; he frankly added, &#8220;but
it would not tend to bear out your superstition, sir; you
are possibly thinking that it might.&#8221; &#8220;If I have sat
down once with thirteen, I have sat down fifty times,&#8221;
cried Major Black, &#8220;and we all lived the year out and
many after that. I would not mention such nonsense
again, if I were you.&#8221; The young man did not answer for
a moment, he was enjoying a glass of wine. &#8220;Only notice,
that&#8217;s all,&#8221; said he, &#8220;I don&#8217;t want to act the simpleton,
but I don&#8217;t like to sit down with thirteen.&#8221; &#8220;Could we
not make Bell the scapegoat and invoke the evil to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_92"></a>[92]</span>
fall on his head?&#8221; cried a mocking voice. &#8220;It is his fault.&#8221;
&#8220;Mr. Feathersmith,&#8221; interrupted another, &#8220;how do
you estimate the time? Is the damage to accrue before
this year is out or do you give us full twelve months
from this evening?&#8221; &#8220;Ridicule me as much as you like,&#8221;
said the young man, good humoredly. &#8220;All I say is,
notice if every one of us now here are alive this time next
year, then I&#8217;ll not put faith in it again. I hope we shall
be.&#8221; &#8220;I hope we shall be, too,&#8221; said Major Black. &#8220;You
are a social subject, though, to invite to dinner. I should
fancy Mr. George Taylor was thinking so.&#8221; Mr. George
Taylor appeared to be thinking of something that
rendered him somewhat mentally disturbed, in point of
fact his duties as host were considerably broken into by
listening at the door; above the conversation, the clatter
of plates, the drawing of corks, his ear was alive, hoping
for the knock which would announce Mr. Bell.</p>

<p>It was, of course, strange that he neither came nor
sent, but no knock seemed to come and George could
only rally his powers and forget him. It was a recherche
repast. George Taylor&#8217;s state dinners always were; no
trouble or expense was spared at them; luxuries in season
and out of season were there; the turtle would seem
richer at his table than any other, the venison more than
venison, the turkeys had a sweeter flavor, the sparkling
champagne was of the rarest vintage, the dinner this
day did not disgrace its predecessors and the guests
seemed to enjoy themselves to the utmost in spite of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_93"></a>[93]</span>
absence of Mr. Bell and Mr. Feathersmith&#8217;s prognostications
thereon. The evening was drawing on, and some
of the gentlemen were solacing themselves with a cup of
coffee, when the butler slipped a note into George&#8217;s hand.
&#8220;The man is waiting for an answer, sir,&#8221; he whispered.
George glided out of the room and read it, so fully impressed
was he that it came from Mr. Bell explaining
the cause of his absence that he had to read it twice over
before he could take in the fact that it was not from him;
it was few lines in pencil from the popular hotel and running
as follows: &#8220;Dear George, I am not feeling well and
have stopped here on my journey, call at once or I shall
be gone to bed, Adam Miller.&#8221; One burning desire
had hung over George all the evening that he could run
up to Bell&#8217;s, and learn the cause of his absence. His absence
in itself would not in the least have troubled
George, but he had a most urgent reason for wishing to
see him, hence his anxiety. To leave his guests to
themselves would have been scarcely the thing, but
this note appeared to afford just the excuse wanting,
at any rate he determined to make it the excuse. &#8220;A
messenger brought this, I suppose,&#8221; he said to the butler.
&#8220;Yes, sir.&#8221; &#8220;My compliments and I will be with
Mr. Miller directly.&#8221; George went into the room again,
intending to proclaim his proposed absence and plead
Mr. Miller&#8217;s illness which he would put up in a strong
light as his justification for the inroad upon good manners
a sudden thought came over him that he would only<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_94"></a>[94]</span>
tell Charles. George drew him aside, &#8220;Charles, you be
host for me for half an hour,&#8221; he whispered. &#8220;Mr.
Miller has just sent me an urgent summons to come and
see him at the hotel; he was passing through here and
was compelled to stop for sickness.&#8221; &#8220;Won&#8217;t to-morrow
morning do?&#8221; asked Charles. &#8220;No, I will be back
before they have time to miss me, if they do miss me, say
it is a duty of friendship that any one of them would have
answered as I am doing, if called upon. I&#8217;ll soon be
back.&#8221; Away he went. Charles felt unusually well
that evening and exerted himself for his cousin. Once out
of the house George hesitated whether he should go
to see Mr. Bell or Mr. Miller. He went to Mr. Miller.
They had been friends first at school, then at college,
and since up to now. &#8220;I am sorry to have sent for
you,&#8221; exclaimed Mr. Miller holding out his hand. &#8220;I
hear you have friends this evening.&#8221; &#8220;It&#8217;s the kindest
thing you could have done for me this evening,&#8221; answered
George. &#8220;I would have given anything for a
plea to be absent myself, and your letter came and afforded
it.&#8221; What, else they said, was between themselves;
it was not much, and in five minutes he was on
his way to Bell&#8217;s; on he strode his eager feet scarcely
touching the ground, he lifted his hat and wiped his brow,
hot with anxiety; it was a very bright night the moon
high; he reached the mansion, and rang the bell: &#8220;Is
Mr. Bell at home?&#8221; &#8220;He&#8217;s gone to the North River,&#8221;
was the answer. &#8220;A pretty trick he played me this<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_95"></a>[95]</span>
evening,&#8221; said George in a tone of dismay. &#8220;What
trick,&#8221; repeated the house-keeper. &#8220;Gone to North
River, it cannot be.&#8221; &#8220;He is,&#8221; said she positively; &#8220;when
I came from market, I found him going off by the train
he had received a message which took him up.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why did he not call upon me, he knew the necessity
there was for me to see him, he ought to have
come.&#8221; &#8220;I conclude he was in a hurry to catch the
train,&#8221; said she. &#8220;Why did he not send?&#8221; &#8220;I heard
him send a verbal message by one of the servants to the
effect that he was summoned unexpectedly to North
River, and could not, therefore, attend your dinner.
How early you have broken up!&#8221; &#8220;We have not
broken up, I left my guests to see after him. No message
was brought to me.&#8221; &#8220;Then I will enquire,&#8221; began
she, rising, but George waved her back. &#8220;It is of
little consequence,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It might have saved me
some suspense, but I am glad I got the dinner over without
knowing it. I would like to see him.&#8221; George
arose to go. &#8220;Not there, not that way,&#8221; she said, for
George was turning as if he would go into a dark hall,
and she arose and went with him to the door. He intended
to take the lonely road homewards, that dark,
narrow road you may remember, where the maple trees
met overhead. All at once George Taylor did take a
step back with a start, when just inside the walk there
came a dismal groan from some dark figure seated on a
broken bench. It was all dark there, the thick maple<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_96"></a>[96]</span>
trees hid the moon. George had just emerged from
where her beams shone bright and open, and not at first
did he distinguish who was sitting there, but his eyes
grew accustomed to the obscurity. &#8220;Charles,&#8221; he uttered
in consternation, &#8220;is that you?&#8221; For answer,
Charles Taylor caught hold of his cousin, bent forward
and laid his head on George&#8217;s arm, another deep groan
breaking from him; that George Taylor would rather
have been waylaid by a real ghost than by his
cousin at that particular time and place, was certain;
better that the whole world should detect any undue
anxiety for Mr. Bell&#8217;s companionship then than Charles
Taylor, at least George thought so, but conscience makes
the best of us cowards, nevertheless he gave his earnest
sympathy to his cousin. &#8220;Lean on me Charles, let me
support you, how have you been taken sick?&#8221; another
minute and the paroxysm of pain was past. Charles
wiped the moisture from his brow, and George sat
down on the narrow bench beside him. &#8220;How came
you to be here alone, Charles. Where is your carriage?&#8221;
&#8220;I ordered the carriage early and it came just as you
were going away,&#8221; explained Charles. &#8220;Feeling well,
I sent it away again, saying I would walk home, the
pain struck me just as I reached this spot and but for
the bench I should have fallen.&#8221; &#8220;But George, what
brings you here?&#8221; was the next very natural question.
&#8220;You told me that you was going to see Miller?&#8221; &#8220;So
I was&mdash;so I did,&#8221; said George, speaking volubly. &#8220;I<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_97"></a>[97]</span>
found him poorly, I told him that he would do better in
bed and came away; it was a nice night; I felt inclined
for a run, and went to Bell&#8217;s to ask what kept him away.
He was sent for up at North River it seems, and sent
an apology, but I did not get it. In some way or other
I think it was misplaced by the servants.&#8221; Charles Taylor
might well have rejoined &#8220;If Bell was away where
did you stop,&#8221; but he made no remark. &#8220;Are they all
gone,&#8221; asked George, alluding to his guests. &#8220;They
are all gone, I made it right with them respecting your
absence; my being there was almost the same thing,
they appeared to regard it so. George, I believe I must
have your arm as far as the house, see what an old
man I am getting to be.&#8221; &#8220;Will you not rest longer, I
am in no hurry as they have gone? What can this
pain be that seems to be attacking you of late?&#8221; &#8220;Has
it never occurred to you what it might be?&#8221; rejoined
Charles. &#8220;No,&#8221; replied George, but he noticed that
Charles&#8217; tone was a peculiar one, and he began to think
of all the ailments that flesh is heir to. &#8220;It cannot be
rheumatism, can it Charles?&#8221; &#8220;It is something worse
than rheumatism,&#8221; he said, in his serene, ever thoughtful
tone. &#8220;A short time George, and you will control
my share of the business.&#8221; George&#8217;s heart seemed to
stand still and then bound onward in a tumult.
&#8220;What do you mean, Charles; what do you think
is the matter with you?&#8221; &#8220;Do you remember
what killed my mother?&#8221; There was a painful<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_98"></a>[98]</span>
pause. &#8220;Oh, Charles!&#8221; &#8220;That is it,&#8221; said Charles
quietly. &#8220;I hope you are mistaken! I hope you are
mistaken!&#8221; reiterated George. &#8220;Have you a physician;
you must have advice!&#8221; &#8220;I have had it, Brown confirms
my suspicions. I asked for the truth.&#8221; &#8220;Who is
Brown,&#8221; returned George, disparagingly. &#8220;Go to
London, Charles, and consult the best medical men
there.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;For the satisfaction of you all I can do so,&#8221; he replied;
&#8220;but it will not benefit me.&#8221; &#8220;Good heavens!
what a dreadful thing,&#8221; uttered George, with feeling;
&#8220;what a blow to fall upon you.&#8221; &#8220;You would regard
it so were it to fall upon you, and naturally you
are young, joyous, and have something to live for.&#8221;
George Taylor did not feel joyous then, had not felt
particularly joyous for a long time; some how his own
care was a burden to him; he lifted his right hand to
his temple and kept it there; Charles suffered his own
hand to fall upon George&#8217;s left, which rested on his knee.
&#8220;Don&#8217;t grieve, George, I am more than resigned. I
think of it as a happy change; this world at its best is
full of care; if we seem free from it one year it only
falls more unsparingly the next; it is wisely ordered,
were the world made too pleasant for us, we might be
wishing it was our permanent home; few weary of it,
whatever may be their care, until they have learned to
look for a better. In the days gone by, I have felt
tempted to wonder why Janey should have been taken,&#8221;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_99"></a>[99]</span>
resumed Charles. &#8220;I see now how merciful the fiat
was, George. I have been more thoughtfully observant
perhaps, than many are, and I have learned to see, to
know, how marvelously all the fiats are fraught with
mercy; full of dark sorrows as they may seem to us, it
would have been a bitter trial to me to leave her here
unprotected in deep sorrow. I scarcely think I could
have been reconciled to go, and I know what her grief would
have been. All&#8217;s for the best.&#8221; Very rare was it for
undemonstrative Charles thus to express his hidden sentiments.
George never knew him to do so before; the
time and place were peculiarly fitted for it, the still, bright
night, telling of peacefulness, the shady trees around,
the blue sky overhead; in these paroxysms of pain
Charles felt himself brought face to face with death.
&#8220;It will be a blow to Mary,&#8221; said George, the thought
striking him. &#8220;She will feel it as one. Charles, can nothing
be done for you?&#8221; was the impulsive rejoinder.
&#8220;Could it have been done for my mother?&#8221; &#8220;I know,
but since then science has been broadened; diseases once
incurable yield now to medical skill. I wish you would
go to London. There are some diseases which bring
death with them in spite of human skill, which will bring
it to the end of time,&#8221; rejoined Charles. &#8220;This is one.&#8221;
&#8220;Well, Charles, you have given me enough for to-night,
and for a great many more nights and days, too. I wish
I had not heard it; it is a dreadful affliction for you.
I must say it is a dreadful affliction.&#8221; &#8220;The disease or<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_100"></a>[100]</span>
the ending you mean?&#8221; asked Charles, with a smile.
&#8220;Both are, but I spoke more particularly of the disease.
The disease in itself is a lingering death, and nothing
better.&#8221; &#8220;A lingering death is the most favored, as I
regard it; a sudden death the most unhappy one. See
what time has given me to set my house in order,&#8221; he
added, the sober smile deepening. &#8220;I must not fail to
do it well.&#8221; &#8220;And the pain, Charles, that will be lingering,
too.&#8221; &#8220;I must bear it.&#8221; He rose as he spoke, and
put his arm in his cousin&#8217;s. He stood a minute or two
as if getting strength, and then walked on, leaning heavily
on George. It was the pain, the excessive agony,
that unnerved him; a little while, and he would seem in
the possession of his strength again. &#8220;George, I can
not tell how you will manage the business when I am
gone,&#8221; he continued, more in a business-like tone. &#8220;I
think of it a great deal. Sometimes I fancy it might be
better if you took a staid, sober partner, one of middle
age, a thorough man of business. Great confidence has
been accorded me, you know, George. I suppose people
like my steady habits.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They like you for your honest integrity;&#8221; returned
George, the words seemed to break from him impulsively,
&#8220;I shall manage very well, I dare say, when the
time comes, I suppose I must settle down to business to
be more like what you have been, I can,&#8221; he continued in
a sort of soliloquy, &#8220;I can, and I will.&#8221; But they walked
on slowly neither saying a word until they reached the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_101"></a>[101]</span>
house. George shook hands with his cousin, &#8220;don&#8217;t
you attempt to come to business to-morrow,&#8221; he said,
&#8220;I will come up in the evening to see you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Won&#8217;t you come in now, George?&#8221; &#8220;Thank you.
Good night, Charles, I heartily wish you better.&#8221; There
went on the progress of a few days and another week
had dawned and Charles seemed to all appearances to be
improving, he arose now to the early breakfast table, he
began to hasten to business for there was much work
there with the accounts, and one morning when they
were at breakfast the old servant entered with one or
two letters for Charles, but before the old man could
reach his master, whose back was toward the door, Mary
made him a sign and he laid the letters down on a remote
table. Charles had been receiving a large number
of letters of late, and Mary was fearful that so much business
might bring on another of those spells and deemed
it just as well that he should at least eat his breakfast in
peace. The circumstances of the letters having passed
from her mind he ate on in silence, but Martha and Matilda
were discussing certain news which they had received
the previous day, news which had surprised them
concerning the engagement of a lady who had looked
upon matrimony as folly.</p>

<small>CHARLES RECEIVES ANOTHER STROKE.</small></h2></div>

<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/i_106.jpg" height="50" alt=""/>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">BUSY talking they did not particularly notice that
Charles had risen from his chair at the breakfast
table and was seated at a distant table opening
his letters until a faint sound, something like a
groan, startled them; he was leaning back in his chair
seemingly unconscious, his hands had fallen, his face
gave signs of the grave; surely those dews upon it were
not the dews of death! Martha screamed, Matilda
flung open the door and called out for help; Mary only
turned to them her hands lifted to enjoin silence, a warning
word upon her lips, their old servant came running
in and looked at Charles. &#8220;He&#8217;ll be better directly,&#8221;
he whispered. &#8220;Yes, he will be better,&#8221; assented Mary,
&#8220;but I should call the doctor.&#8221; Charles began to revive.
He slowly opened his eyes and raised his hand
to wipe the moisture from his white brow. On the table
before him lay one of the letters open. Mary pushed
the letters aside with a gesture of grievous vexation.
&#8220;It is this business that has affected you,&#8221; she cried out<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_103"></a>[103]</span>
with a wail. &#8220;Not so,&#8221; breathed Charles. &#8220;It was
the pain here.&#8221; He touched himself below the chest in
the same place where the pain had been before. What
had caused the pain, mental agony arising from overwork
or the physical agony arising from disease? Probably
some of both. He stretched out his hand toward the
letters making a motion that they should be placed in
envelopes. George, who could not have read a word
without his glasses, took up the letters, folded them and
put them in their envelopes. Charles&#8217; mind seemed at
rest and he closed his eyes again. &#8220;I&#8217;ll step for the
doctor now,&#8221; whispered George to Mary, &#8220;I shall catch
him before he goes out on his rounds.&#8221; He took his hat
and went down the road to the office, putting forth his
best step, when he reached the office the doctor had
gone. &#8220;Will he be long,&#8221; asked George? &#8220;I don&#8217;t
know,&#8221; was the reply, &#8220;he was called out at seven this
morning.&#8221; &#8220;He is wanted at the Taylor mansion. Mr.
Taylor is worse.&#8221; &#8220;Is he?&#8221; returned the assistant, his
quick tone indicating concern. &#8220;I can tell you where he
is, and that&#8217;s at Bangs,&#8221; continued the assistant. &#8220;You
might call and speak to him if you like, it&#8217;s on your way
home.&#8221; George hastened there and succeeded in finding
the doctor. He informed him that Charles was worse;
was very sick. &#8220;One of the old attacks of pain, I suppose,&#8221;
said the doctor. &#8220;Yes, sir,&#8221; answered George.
&#8220;He was taken sick while answering letters. Miss
Mary thought it might be overwork that brought it on.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_104"></a>[104]</span>&#8220;Ah!&#8221; said the doctor, and there was a world of emphasis
on the monosyllable. &#8220;Well, I shan&#8217;t be detained
here over half an hour longer, and I shall
come straight up.&#8221; He reached there within half an
hour after George. Mary saw him approaching and
came into the hall to meet him. She was looking
very sad and pale. &#8220;Another attack, I hear,&#8221;
began the doctor, in his unceremonious mode of salutation,
&#8220;bothered into it, I suppose; George says it came
on while he was reading letters.&#8221; &#8220;Yes,&#8221; answered
Mary, in acquiescence, her tone a resentful one. &#8220;It
was brought on by overwork.&#8221; The doctor gave a
groan as he turned towards the stairs. &#8220;Not there,&#8221;
interposed Mary, &#8220;he is in the dining-room.&#8221; With the
wan, white look upon his face, with the moisture of pain
on his brow lay Charles Taylor. He was on the sofa
now, but he partially rose from it and assumed a sitting
posture when the doctor entered. A few professional
questions and answers and then the doctor began to
scold. &#8220;Did I not warn you that you must have perfect
tranquility,&#8221; cried he, &#8220;rest of body and of mind?&#8221; &#8220;You
did, but how am I to get it, even now I ought to be at
the office. I shall die however it may be, doctor,&#8221; was
the reply of Charles Taylor. &#8220;So will most of us, I
expect,&#8221; returned the doctor, &#8220;but there&#8217;s no necessity
for us to be helped on to it ages before death would
come of itself.&#8221; &#8220;True,&#8221; replied Charles, but his tone
was not a hopeful one. There was a pause, Charles<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_105"></a>[105]</span>
broke it. &#8220;I wish you could give me something to avert
these sharp attacks of pain, doctor, it is agony in fact,
not pain.&#8221; &#8220;I know it,&#8221; replied the doctor. &#8220;What&#8217;s
the use of my attempting to give you anything? You
don&#8217;t take my prescription.&#8221; Charles lifted his eyes in
surprise. &#8220;I have taken all that you desired me.&#8221; &#8220;No,
you have not; I prescribe tranquillity of mind and body;
you take neither.&#8221; Charles leaned nearer to the doctor
and paused before he answered. &#8220;Tranquillity of mind
for me has passed, I can never know it again; were my
life to be prolonged by the great healer of all things,
time might bring it to me in a degree, but for that I
shall not live, doctor; you must know this to be the case
under the calamity which has fallen upon my head.&#8221;
&#8220;At any rate you cannot go on facing business any
longer.&#8221; &#8220;I must, indeed, there is no help for it.&#8221;
&#8220;And suppose it kills you,&#8221; was the retort. &#8220;If I could
help going I would,&#8221; said Charles. &#8220;George has gone
away.&#8221; The doctor arose and departed after giving
Charles a severe lecture. Miss Taylor sat at one of the
west windows, her cheek rested pensively on her fingers
as she thought, oh, with what bitterness of the grievous
past she sat there losing herself in regret after regret.
If my father and mother had not died; she lost herself,
I say, in these regrets, bitter as they were vain. How
many of these useless regrets might embitter the lives of
us all, how many do embitter them? If I had but done
so and so; if I had taken the right when I turned to the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_106"></a>[106]</span>
wrong; if I had known who that person was from the
first and shunned his acquaintance; if I had chosen that
path in life instead of this one; if I had, in short, done
exactly the opposite to what I did do. Vain, vain repinings;
vain, useless repinings. The only plan is to
keep them as far as possible from our hearts. If we
could foresee the end of a thing at its beginning, if we
could buy a stock of experience at the outset of life, if
we could, in fact, become endowed with the light of
divine wisdom, what different men and women the
world would see. But we cannot undo the past, it is
ours with all its folly, its shortsightedness. Perhaps its
guilt, though we stretch out our yearning and pitiful
hands to Heaven in their movement of agony, though
we wail out our bitter my Lord pardon me! heal me!
help me! though we beat on our remorseful bosom and
tear away its flesh piecemeal in bitter repentance. We
cannot undo the past; we cannot undo it. The past
remains to us unaltered, and must remain so forever.
Perhaps some idea of this kind of the utter uselessness
of these regrets, but no personal remorse attached to
her, was making itself heard in the mind of Miss Taylor
even through her grief. She had clasped her hands
upon her bosom now and bent her head downwards,
completely lost in retrospect.</p>

<p>She was aroused by the entrance of Charles. He sat
opposite her at the other corner of the window; he appeared
to be buried in thought, neither spoke a word;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_107"></a>[107]</span>
presently Mary arose to leave the room and George met
her almost immediately, showing in Mr. Blakely. He
hastened forward to prevent Charles from rising. Laying
one hand upon his shoulder and the other on his hands
he pressed him down and would not let him rise. The
slanting rays of the setting sun were falling on the face
of Charles Taylor, lighting up its handsome outlines, the
cheeks were thinner, the hair seemed scantier, the truthful
gray eyes had acquired an habitual expression of
pain. Mr. Blakely leaned over him and noted it all.
&#8220;Sit down,&#8221; said Charles, drawing the chair which had
been occupied by Mary nearer to him. Mr. Blakely
accepted the invitation, but did not release the hand.
They subsided into conversation, its theme as was
natural, the health of Charles and the topics of the day and
weather. Charles sat in calmness waiting for him to
proceed; nothing could stir him greatly now. Mr.
Blakely gave him the outline of the past, of his love for
Martha and her rejection of him. &#8220;There has been
something in her manner of late,&#8221; he continued, &#8220;which
has renewed hope within me, otherwise I should not be
saying this to you now; quite of late, since her rejection
of me, I have observed what I could not describe, and I
have determined to risk my fate once more.&#8221; &#8220;But I
did not know that you loved Martha.&#8221; &#8220;I suppose not.
It has seemed to me, though, that my love must have
been patent to the world. You would give her to me,
would you not?&#8221; &#8220;Thankfully,&#8221; was the warm answer.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_108"></a>[108]</span>
&#8220;The thought of leaving these girls unprotected has
been one of my cares. Let me give you one consolation
Blakely, that if Martha has rejected you she has rejected
others. Mary fancied she had some secret attachment;
can it have been concerning yourself?&#8221; &#8220;If
so why has she rejected me?&#8221; &#8220;I don&#8217;t know; she has
been grievously unhappy since I have been sick, almost
like one who had no further hope in life.&#8221; &#8220;What is it,
George?&#8221; &#8220;A message has come from Mrs. Bangs.&#8221;
Charles spoke a word of apology to Blakely and left the
room; in the hall he met Martha crossing to it; she went
in quite unconscious who was its occupant; he rose to
welcome her. A momentary hesitation in her steps, a
doubt whether she should not run away again, and then
she recalled her senses and went forward. How it went
on and what was exactly said or done neither of them
could remember afterwards. A very few minutes and
Martha&#8217;s head was resting upon his shoulder; all the
mistakes of the past cleared up between them. She
might not have confessed to him how long she had loved,
all since that long time when they were together at his
home, but for her dread that he might think she was
only accepting him on account of Charles&#8217; days being
numbered. She told the truth, that she had loved him
and him only all along. &#8220;Martha, my dear, what a long
misery might have been spared me had I known this.&#8221;
Martha looked down. Perhaps some might have been
spared her also. &#8220;Would you like to live here?&#8221; asked<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_109"></a>[109]</span>
Mark. &#8220;Oh, yes; if it can be.&#8221; &#8220;They will be glad to
have me set a price on some of these houses around
here.&#8221; Martha&#8217;s eyelids were bent on her hot cheeks;
she did not raise them. &#8220;If you like we might ask
Mary and Matilda to live with us,&#8221; resumed Mark
Blakely in his thoughtful consideration. &#8220;Our home
will be large enough.&#8221; &#8220;Their home is decided upon,&#8221;
said Martha shaking her head, &#8220;and they will remain in
their own home. Mary has an annuity, you know; it
was money left to her by mamma&#8217;s sister, so that she is
independent; can live where she pleases; but I am sure
she will go to New York on a visit as soon as&#8221;&mdash;&#8220;I
understand you Martha; as soon as Charles shall have
passed away.&#8221; The tears were glistening in her eyes.
&#8220;Do you not see a great change in him?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A very great one, Martha; I should like him to give
you to me. Will you waive ceremony and be mine at
once?&#8221; &#8220;At once,&#8221; she repeated, stammering and looking
at him. &#8220;I mean in the course of a week or two,
as soon as you can make it convenient. Surely we have
waited long enough.&#8221; &#8220;I will see,&#8221; murmured Martha,
a grave expression arose to Mr. Blakely&#8217;s face. &#8220;It
must not be very long, Martha, if you would be
mine while your brother is in life.&#8221; &#8220;I will! I will! it
shall be as you wish,&#8221; she answered, the tears falling
from her eyes, and before she could make any rejoinder
she had hastily quitted him, and standing before
the window stealthily drying her wet cheeks, for the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_110"></a>[110]</span>
door had opened and Charles Taylor had entered
the room.</p>

<p>All the neighbors of Bellville lingered at its doors and
windows curious to witness the outer signs of Martha
Taylor&#8217;s wedding; the arrangements for it were to them
more a matter of speculation than of certainty since various
rumors had been afloat and were eagerly caught up,
although of the most contradictory character, all that appeared
certain as yet, was that the day was charming
and the bells were ringing; to keep the crowd back was
an impossibility and when the first carriage came, the
excitement in the street was great; it was drawn by two
beautiful horses, the livery of the postillions and the crest
on the panels of the carriage proclaimed it to be Charles
Taylor&#8217;s. Mark Blakely sat inside with Martha, the next
carriage contained the sisters and Charles Taylor, the third
contained the bridesmaids wearing hats and beautiful
gowns, and the others coming up contained the aristocratic
friends of the parties concerned; there was a low murmur
of sorrow, of sympathy and it was called forth by
the appearance of Charles Taylor; it was some little
time now since Charles Taylor had been seen in public
and the change in him was startling; he walked forward
leaning on the arm of George Taylor, lifting his hat to
the greeting that was breathed around, a greeting of
sorrow meant, as he knew, for him and his blighted life,
the few scanty hairs stood out to their view as he uncovered
his head, and the ravages of the disease that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_111"></a>[111]</span>
was killing him were all too conspicuous on his wasted
features. &#8220;God bless him, he&#8217;s very near to the grave,&#8221;
who said this among the crowd, Charles could not tell, but
the words and their pathos full of rude sympathy came
distinctly upon his ear. The Reverend Mr. Davis stood
at the altar, he, too had changed, the keen, vigorous,
healthy man had now a gray worn look; he stood there
waiting for the wedding party; the pews were filled
with ladies dressed appropriately for the occasion, and
the church was filled with sweet-smelling flowers and
their fragrance filled the air; the bridesmaids led the
way, then came Martha and Charles Taylor; she wore
an elegant gown of white satin, a tulle veil and orange
blossoms, diamond ornaments, the gift of the groom&mdash;as
lovely a bride as ever stood at the altar. Mr. Blakely
and Miss Mary Taylor came next; she wore a gray silk
of rare modern pattern. The recollection of the
wedding service that he had promised to perform for
Charles Taylor and Janey Brewster caused the pastor&#8217;s
voice to be subdued now as he read; how had that contemplated
union ended; the pastor was thinking it over
now. This one was over, the promises made, the register
signed and parson Davis stepped before them and took
the hand of Martha. &#8220;I pray God that your union
may be a happy one; that rests in a great degree
with you; Mark Blakely, take care of her,&#8221; her
eyes filled with tears, but Blakely grasped his hand
warmly and said: &#8220;I will! I will.&#8221; &#8220;Let me bless you<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_112"></a>[112]</span>
both, Blakely,&#8221; broke in the quiet voice of Charles Taylor.
&#8220;It may be that I shall not see you again.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! but we shall meet again, you must not die yet,&#8221;
exclaimed Mark Blakely with feverish eagerness. &#8220;My
friend I would rather part with the whole world, save
Martha than with you.&#8221; Their hands lingered together
and separated. They reached the carriage, notwithstanding
the crowd pushed and danced around it, the
placing in of Martha, and Mark taking his seat beside her,
seemed to be but the work of a moment, so quickly was
it done, and Mark Blakely, a pleasant smile upon his
face, bowed to the shouts on either side as the carriage
wended its way through the crowd, not until it had got
into clear ground did the postillions put their horses to a
canter, and the bride and groom were fairly on their
bridal tour. There was more ceremony needed to place
the ladies in the other carriages. Miss Taylor&#8217;s skirts
in their extensive richness took five minutes to arrange
themselves, ere a space could be found for Charles
beside her, the footman held the door for him, the other
carriages drove up in order and were driven quietly
away, after having been filled with fair ladies and their
escorts.</p>

<small>A PEACEFUL HOUR.</small></h2></div>

<div>

</div>


<p class="drop-cap">IN the old porch at Bellville, of which you have read so
much, sat Charles Taylor. An invalid-chair had been
placed there, and he lay back on its pillows in the beams
of the afternoon sun of the late autumn; a warm sunny
day it had been. He was feeling wonderously well; almost,
but for his ever present weakness, quite well; his fatigue
of the previous day, that of Martha&#8217;s wedding, had left
no permanent effects upon him, and had he not known
thoroughly his own hopeless state he might have fancied
this afternoon that he was approaching convalescence.
Not in his looks, pale, wan, ghastly were they,
the shadow of the grim implacable visitor, that was so
soon to come, was already on them; but the face in its
calm, stillness told of ineffable peace. The brunt of the
storm had passed. The white walls of the Taylor
mansion glittered brightly in the distance, the dark blue
sky was seen through the branches of the trees, growing
bare and more bare against the coming winter. The
warm rays of the sun fell on Charles Taylor. In his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_114"></a>[114]</span>
hand he held a book from which others than Charles
Taylor have derived consolation and courage. &#8220;God is
love.&#8221; He was reading at that moment of the great
love of God towards those who strive as he had done to
live for him. He looked up, repeating the sentence,
&#8220;He loves them in death and will love them through the
never ending ages to come.&#8221; Just then his eyes fell on
the figure of George, their old servant man, who was
advancing towards the mansion. Charles closed his
book and held out his hand. &#8220;You are not going to
leave us yet, Mr. Taylor.&#8221; &#8220;I know not how soon it
may be George, very long it cannot be; sit down.&#8221; He
stood yet, however, looking at him, disregarding the
bench to which he had pointed, stood with a saddened expression
and compressed lips. George&#8217;s eye was an
experienced one, and it may be that he saw the picture
which had taken up its abode in his face.</p>

<p>&#8220;You be going to see my old master and mistress sir,&#8221;
he said dashing some rebellious moisture from his eyes.
&#8220;Mr. Charles do you remember it, my poor mistress sat
here in this porch the very day she died.&#8221; &#8220;I remember
it well, George. I am dying quietly, thank God, as my
mother died.&#8221; &#8220;And what a blessing it is when folks
can die quietly with their conscience, and all about &#8217;em
at peace,&#8221; ejaculated George. &#8220;I am on the threshold
of a better world, George,&#8221; was his quiet answer, &#8220;one
where sorrow cannot enter.&#8221; George sat for some little
time on the bench talking to him, they had gone back<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_115"></a>[115]</span>
in thought to old times, to the illness and death of his
mother, to the long gone scenes of the past, whether
of pleasure or pain&mdash;a past which for us all seems to
bear a charm when recalled to the memory which
it had never borne; at length George arose to depart,
declining to remain longer; Charles was in his
armchair seated by the fire as Mary entered the room,
his face would have been utterly colorless save for the
bluish tinge which had settled there a tinge distinguishable
even in the red blaze. &#8220;Have you come back
alone,&#8221; asked Charles, turning towards her. &#8220;George
Taylor accompanied me as far as the head of the street.
Have you had your medicine, Charles?&#8221; &#8220;Yes.&#8221; Mary
drew a chair near to him, and sat down, glancing almost
stealthily at him; when this ominous look appears on the
human face we do not like to look into it too boldly lest
its owner, so soon to be called away, may read the fiat
in our own dread countenance, she need not have feared
its effects, had he done so, on Charles Taylor. &#8220;How
are you feeling to night?&#8221; somewhat abruptly asked
Mary. &#8220;Never better of late days; it seems as if ease
both of mind and body has come to me.&#8221; Mary turned
her eyes from the fire that the tears rising in them might
not be seen to glisten, and exclaimed: &#8220;What a misfortune.&#8221;
&#8220;A misfortune to be taken to my rest, to the
good God who has so loved and kept me here. A few
minutes before you came in I fell into a doze and I
dreamt I saw Jesus Christ standing by the window waiting<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_116"></a>[116]</span>
for me, he had his hand stretched out to me with a
smile, so vivid had been the impression that when I
awoke, I thought it was a reality. Death a misfortune!
no, Mary, not for me.&#8221; Mary rang the bell for lights
to be brought in, Charles, his elbow resting on the arm
of his chair, bent his head upon his hand and became
lost in the imagination of glories that might so soon open
to him, bright forms were flitting around a throne of
wondrous beauty, golden harps in their hands, and in
one of them, her harp idle, her radiant face turned as if
watching for one who might be coming, he seemed to
recognize Janey. A misfortune for the good to die! No.</p>

<p>George Taylor, a cousin to this family, was seated at
his desk in the office when his attention was called by a
rap at the door. George opened the door, and the old servant
came in. &#8220;It is all over, sir,&#8221; he said; his manner
strangely still, his voice unnaturally calm and low, as is
sometimes the case where emotion is striven to be suppressed.
Miss Mary bade me come to you with the tidings.
George&#8217;s bearing was suspiciously quiet, too. &#8220;It is very
sudden,&#8221; he presently rejoined. &#8220;Very sudden, sir, and
yet my mistress did not seem unprepared for it, he took
his tea with her, and was so cheerful over it that I began
to hope he had taken a fresh turn, my mistress called
me in to give directions about a little matter she wanted
done to-morrow, and while she was speaking to me,
Miss Matilda cried out. We turned round and saw her
leaning over my master, he had slipped back in his chair<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_117"></a>[117]</span>
powerless, and I hastened to raise and support him. Death
was in his face, there was no mistaking it, but he was
quite conscious, quite sensible and smiled at us. &#8216;I must
say farewell to you,&#8217; he said, and Miss Matilda burst
into a fit of sobs, but my mistress kneeled down quietly
before him and took his hands in hers and said, &#8216;Charles,
is the moment come?&#8217; &#8216;Yes, it is come;&#8217; he answered,
and tried to look round at Miss Matilda, who stood a
little behind his chair. &#8216;Don&#8217;t grieve,&#8217; he said, &#8216;I am
going on first,&#8217; but she only sobbed the more. &#8216;Good
by, my dear ones,&#8217; he continued, &#8216;I shall wait for you all
as I know I am being waited for.&#8217; &#8216;Fear?&#8217; he went on,
for Miss Matilda sobbed out something that sounded
like the word. &#8216;Fear, when I am going to God, when I
saw Jesus&mdash;Jesus&mdash;&#8217;&#8221; George fairly broke down with a
great burst of grief, and the tears were silently rolling over
the old man&#8217;s cheeks. &#8220;It was the last word he spoke,
&#8216;Jesus,&#8217; his voice ceased, his hands fell, and the eyelids
dropped, there was no struggle, nothing but a long gentle
breath, and he died with the smile upon his lips.&#8221;
Cousin George leaned his head on the side of the window
to subdue his emotion, to gather the outward calmness
that man likes not to have ruffled before the world; he
listened to the strokes of the passing bell ringing out so
sharply in the still night air, and every separate stroke
was laden with its weight of pain.</p>

<p>You might have taken it for Sunday in Bellville, except
that Sundays in ordinary do not look so gloomy; the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_118"></a>[118]</span>
stores were closed, a drizzling rain came down, and the
heavy bell was booming out at solemn intervals; it was
tolling for the funeral of Charles Taylor. Morning and
night from eight to nine had it so tolled since his death, he
had gone to his long home, to his last resting-place, and
Bellville mourned for him as for a brother. Life wears different
aspects for us and its cares and its joys are unequally
allotted, at least they appear so to be. One glances
up heavily from careworn burdens, and sees others
without care basking in the sunshine, but I often
wonder whether those who seem so gay whose path
seems to be cast on the broad sunshiny road of pleasure
whether they have not a skeleton in their closet; nothing
but gayety, nothing but lightness, nothing to all appearances,
but freedom from care. Is it really so, perhaps
with some, a very few. Is it well for those few? Oh, if
we could but see the truth when the burden upon us is
heavy and pressing. Fellow sufferers, if we could but read
that burden aright, we should see how good it is, and
bless the hand that sends it. But we never can; we are
but mortal; born with a mortal&#8217;s keen susceptibility to
care and pain, we preach to others that these things
are sent for their good, we say so to ourselves when not
actually suffering, but when the fiery trial is upon us
then we groan out in our sore anguish that it is greater
than we can bear. The village clock struck eleven and
the old sexton opened the doors of the church, and the
inhabitants of this beautiful village assembled to see the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_119"></a>[119]</span>
funeral as it came slowly winding along the street to the
sound of the solemn bell; they might have attended him
to the grave following unobtrusively, but that was known
to be the wish of the family that such demonstration
should not be made. &#8220;Bury me in the plainest manner
possible&#8221; had been his directions when the end was
drawing near. The hearse and carriages are standing
at the mansion; fine horses, with splendid trappings, in
modern carriages, have come from the various parts of
the country near and distant to show their owners&#8217; homage
to that good man who had earned their deepest respect
through life; slowly the procession reached the
church, and the hearse and carriages stopped at it; some
of the carriages filed off, and the drivers turned their
horses&#8217; heads to face the church, and waited still and
quiet while the hearse was emptied. The Reverend Mr.
Davis stood at the altar, book in hand, reciting the commencement
of the service for the burial of the dead,
&#8220;I am the resurrection and the life,&#8221; with measured
steps slowly following went those who bore the coffin;
their heads covered with a black pall, the sisters and
their cousin George came next, with their old servants
following, thus they entered the church, he remained at
the altar, but not reading from it, the church was nearly
filled by ones and twos; they had come in, and when all
was quiet, he read the history of the life of the deceased
in a solemn manner, there was not a dry eye in the
audience; the sermon having been finished, they repaired<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_120"></a>[120]</span>
to the grave, the pastor taking his place at the head,
and read the service as the coffin was lowered, the
mourners stood next to him, and the other friends were
clustered around, their heads bent, the drizzling rain beat
down upon their bare heads, the doctor came up, unable
to attend earlier, he came now at the last moment, just
as George Taylor had come years ago to the funeral
of Janey Brewster. Did the pastor of Bellville,
standing there with his pale face, his sonorous voice
echoing over the graves, recall those back funerals,
when he over whom the service was now being read
had stood as chief mourner? No doubt he did. Did
George recall it? The pastor glanced at him once, and
saw that he had a difficulty in suppressing his emotion.
&#8220;I heard a voice from Heaven saying unto me, write
from henceforth blessed are the dead which die in the
Lord, even so saith the Spirit, for they rest from their
labors.&#8221; So profound was the silence, that every word
as it fell solemnly from the lips of the minister might be
heard in all parts of the churchyard; if ever that verse
could apply to frail humanity, with its unceasing struggle
after holiness, and its unceasing failure here, it most
surely apply to him over whom it was being spoken.
Bend forward, as so many of those spectators are doing,
and read the inscription on the plate, Charles Taylor,
aged 40 years. Only forty years, a period at which
some men think they are beginning life, it seemed to be
an untimely death, and it would have been, after all his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_121"></a>[121]</span>
pain and sorrow, but that he had entered upon a better
life.</p>

<p>They left him in the vaulted grave, his coffin near his
mother&#8217;s, who lay beside his father; the spectators began
to draw unobtrusively away, silently and solemnly. In
the general crowd and bustle, for everybody was on the
move, George turned to the pastor and shook hands
with him. &#8220;It was a peaceful ending.&#8221; George was
gazing down dreamily as he spoke the last words; the
pastor looked at him. &#8220;A peaceful ending! yes; it
could not be otherwise with him.&#8221; &#8220;No, no,&#8221; murmured
George; &#8220;Not otherwise with him.&#8221; &#8220;May
God in his mercy send us all as happy a one when our
time shall come.&#8221; As the words left the pastor&#8217;s lips
the loud and heavy bell boomed out again, giving notice
to the town that the last rites were over, that life had
closed forever on Charles Taylor.</p>
